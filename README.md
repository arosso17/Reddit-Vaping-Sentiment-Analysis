# Reddit-Vaping-Sentiment-Analysis

This project was developed to strengthen my data skills through web scraping, data cleaning and processing, sentiment analysis, and data visualization.

I scraped data from the reddit API. The data I collected was from various subreddits all related to vaping and e-cigarette usage. 
I used various techniques to clean and tokenize the data. I compared these methods to see the effect on the analysis.

I found that even on subreddits that I expected to be negative, such as quit_vaping, most of the posts' sentiments were positive.
Using topic modeling, I found that testimonials about how vaping helped people stop smoking real cigarettes was the most common.

More detailed analysis results are in the pdf of the analysis slides!
