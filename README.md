# Reddit-Vaping-Sentiment-Analysis

This project was developed to strengthen my skills with data collection through web scraping, data cleaning and processing, sentiment analysis, and data visualization.

The data was scraped from the reddit API. The data I collected was from varius subreddits all related to vaping and e-ciggarette usage. 
I used varius techniques to clean, tokenize the data. I compared these methods to see the effect on the analysis.

I found that even on subreddits that I expected to be negative, such as quit_vaping, most of the post's sentiments were positive.
Using topic modeling, I found that testimonials about how vaping helped people stop smoking real cigarettes was the most common.

More detailed analysis results are in the pdf of the analysis slides!
