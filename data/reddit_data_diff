A few weeks later, he just stopped even having that one cigarette.\n\nI went to that shop and they were awesome. It is run by a guy who isn't interested in selling big fancy complicated rigs, he just kept it simple and directed the hobbyists to a different shop, but made his business for people who just want to stop smoking.\n\nIt has been probably three years since I touched a cigarette.

Immediately I stopped smoking actual cigarettes. Within 6 months I was chewing gum. Now 2 years later I haven't had a single cigarette since.\n\nFor me, nothing worked for over two decades until I started using e-cigarettes. This quite likely saved my life - just the new years before I finally switched I was having an enormous amount of health symptoms - shortness of breath, throbbing head aches, tingling and burning sensations in my extremities. I even passed out briefly at our new years party with a bout of light headedness. \n\nNow, it almost goes without saying, but since making the switch all of those symptoms have disappeared. Not only that but my health has made a huge rebound - I've lost weight since then and I've been able to go to the gym and work out, which was impossible before with my wheezing and gasping and massive blood pressure problems. \n\nIt's impossible for me to overstate this - I am so incredibly thankful that my wife convinced me to give e-cigarettes a try. I don't even want to imagine what would have happened to me if I hadn't made the switch and I heartily recommend it to anyone reading this thread and wishing that they could quit smoking but had failed multiple times like I did.

If you maintain normal smoker\'s etiquette with the vape, you will have no problems. Abuse of that etiquette by douchenozzles in flame shirts is how this lovely advancement got a bad rap. \n\nThis is the one thing I, a middle aged man, am angry at millennials about. Why could you, of all people, not be cool. Why. And stop making Youtube videos about it. Only the dorkiest of Cigar Aficionados made a hobby about tobacco. That was one of the things that made it cool. Nobody actually nerded out about it. You just smoked, all casual. It looked poetic between a lady\'s fingers, and was associated with suffrage. Edward Munch made a point to paint himself [holding one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iu2L7oA9QRg).\n\nDrawbacks. The vape is not cool. It just isn\'t. It doesn\'t LOOK cool. I once had somebody laugh at me for "sucking on the robot dick". Ain\'t nothing free. The main benefit of the cigarette is its slender profile, its poetry, it\'s association with fire. One can talk about breathing the air of hell. \n\nBut. Smoking is not cool. The kids don\'t smoke, these days. It\'s passe. Pretty girls (and lovely boys) didn\'t smoke much before, and now they really, really don\'t. The vape will not make your kiss taste like an ashtray. So even though the vape is a bit lame, well, smoking is even more lame. Those who are inclined to live and let live about vaping, despite its weird rep, will have real and understandable reasons to despise you if you continue to smoke. As I say, keep your smokers etiquette intact, and non-vapers will only comment on how lovely you make their world smell.\n\nIf not for some a-holes trying really hard to be fedora cunts and spoil it, the vape conjures the dream of smoking, rooms full of artful fog, but when the non-smoker walks into this fog, it smells like cherries, or butterscotch, not grimy tobacco. Frankly, you will not enjoy the flavors as much as they will, as scents. \n\nI cannot recommend the practice enough. Vape. Vape while you still can. \n\nAh. One last drawback. As a smoker, you were used to a cigarette being a cigarette forever, with few changes. But the vape is an electronic device made mostly in China. If somebody could recommend an American manufactured vape, please do, for some will care a lot about that. Like all electronics, vapes are constantly updated. New models and designs are forever being pushed out. The best of the designs stick around for a while, but you will be annoyed by your need to update. However, buy a popular model, and you will be satisfied for quite some time.\n\nAs per DONG_MAGNUM (ffs Reddit) posted, your days are sort of numbered here. They will soon regulate vapes into submission, and in a year, I don\'t know if my advice will be worthwhile. But for now, today, January 1st, there has never been a better time to buy a vape and ditch the smokes. I still fire up a cigarette here and there. I am never happy with it. You too can own this look of satisfaction.\n\nI cannot recommend vaping enough.

I probably tried every other avenue out there, I would quit for a week or month and then relapse and fall down the hill harder every time. First stint with vaping was with one of those cheap little stick mods which I hated. No flavor or throat hit to speak of. I went back to smoking after about 3 days of use for about two years. Got my first sub-ohm around 2013-2014. loved it so at the start, the thing was absolutely amazing. A throat hit to rival a cigarette, I was in awe. But that faded, the flavors I was picking were awful, the upkeep because of the fact that I worked in a production factory was too much, and it started to taste nasty every once in a while. Went back to smoking after about 7 months of vaping. \n\nAfter a few weeks of chain smoking, I noticed a change, a dramatic change. Thing's that tasted delicious before were tasting plain, I couldn't smell anything, I was wheezing, finding it much harder to fall asleep, and there was this noticeable odor around me. I know all of this is common knowledge side effect of smoking, but the fact that the change was so apparent really shocked me. I went back to the vape store and spend probably 200$ on the best vape I could possibly think of and talked for an extended period of time about flavors, that was back in February of 2015. I have not had a cigarette in almost 2 years. feels good man.\n\nMy dad recently started vaping as well, bought one of the little stick mods like I told him not too. Much more successful than me with it but he teetered every week and bought a pack when he was drinking or golfing.

It costs about 120$ for the complete package, I personally started saving money after the second month of vaping. Talk with the guys at the desk about flavors, in my experience, they have been extremely helpful in finding a wide range of flavors that I really enjoy.

It hit /r/all and reminded me that I need to kick this shit for good.", "In my opinion its the only way to quit for a very high percentage of people. Compounding that, other methods can have pretty bad side effects. I was a BIG fucking tobacco user. I regularly used pipes, cigars, RYO, unfiltered, dip, chew, spliffs, dokha, hookah, snus, pouches. I was a tobacco enthusiast. 1+ packs a day. Lots of money. Lots of tar. I've been vaping since before it became a thing. When vapes actually got good and I actually for real stopped using tobacco it was life changing. Sometimes I miss a real cigarette but man if I smoke one now its usually pretty fucking gross. Nothing really beats a dip either when you are working in the shop or on the lawn. I don't even dare try to roll one of my fine fine RYO cigs, rizla papers, amsterdam shag, swan filters. But ecig is pretty god damn good and I've got a gallon of liquid that cost me almost nothing and my gums arent fucked up, I don't smell like shit, I can breathe, I can smell, I can ascend stairs, I don't have the threat of heart and lung disease looming all over me, my clothes don't smell like shit, my car doesn't smell like shit, no ashes, no butts, no rolling down the window in the car even, no going outside in the cold, no yellow walls in my apartment, no burns on my couch, no hole in my wallet. \n\nMy biggest advice is get a good liquid and a good vape from the start. I started out when vapes and liquids were both pretty shitty and then in the middle years when shit could get expensive and frustrating I vaped and smoked or dipped. Thats my second biggest advice, get your good vape AND DO NOT SMOKE. I have one friend that vaped and quit and two friends that do both. I seriously can't even stand a cigarette now especially when I got some big hit of chocolately yummy cool vapor right in my pocket. \n\nAs far as cessation I've only ever seen two people quit that I personally know. My dad did every fucking method; inhalers, gum for YEARS, patches, welbutrin, pouches for years (all have side effects worse than vaping AFAIK). After like 12 fucking years supposedly he quit. The other person I know got a shitty ecig and weened himself down by milligram and quit easy. Literally of all the people I personally know thats it. But then theres me, I love nicotine, I love the oral fixation, I love it with a beer, I love it in the car, and I got three batteries and a big fuckin dripper ready to bang bang. \n\nI started with those weird old clear things marketed on the internet that vaped who knows what. It faded out because it sucked then Blu came out. Tried that bullshit it was okay, or so I thought, kept smoking. Vaped on and off for a few years, mostly with a pen style and an old school 306 dripper. Then slightly more quality mods and more powerful tanks started coming out but they were still kinda frustrating and shitty and expensive. When affordable mods and sub-ohm tanks hit the market I entered the golden age. My first decent ecig when I finally quit was an internal battery 35w mod with a 1ohm coil in a tank. Cost me about $75, and it was kind of a piece of shit. Over the years 32mg, to 24mg, to 18mg, usually $13-$20 a bottle. I currently vape a 3 18650 battery mod that holds up to all kinds of abuse and pumps 200 fuckin watts and I got big fat nichrome juggernaut dual coils totalling .2ohms in a Doge and I'm assblastin 100%VG 3mg clouds that cost me THIRTY FIVE CENTS a bottle. \n\nIf you wanna quit go get a decent $20-$30 mod, sub ohm tank, and play around in the 8mg-14mg range until you don't crave. Wheen yourself off down to 0mg and work on getting rid of the fixation. Keep a bottle of 2mg around for emergencies. If you're like me, just start out with a nice $40-$60 mod - a nice tank - and a nice dripper - fuck the drama - play around in the 4mh-8mg range until you can get down to <3mg, and puff the fuck away. Either way your smell will improve, your breath will improve, if you smoke weed your ass gonna be coughin and takin huge hits and gettin hella high and the weed gonna taste hecka good, you gonna be goin up stairs like a motherfucker. \n\nP.S.

You need to consider the device, the nicotine concentration and a lot of small details like supplies and backups.\n\nYou win a world of flavors, a myriad of devices.

It works very well for most people. I'm probably in a minority. During the time I was vaping, cigs made me gag and I hated them. Vaping is delicious and I miss it. But goddamn, it is inconvenient for me as someone who liked to drip and was a chain vaper. It doesnt have to be like that for you thought. get a tank and a simple mod and try it out. Good luck. ", 'Love vaping. Been 4 years smoke free!', "30 year old here. After thirteen years I've been smoke free since June of this year. Enough was enough. My buddy actually set me up with my first mod and a few coils and different juices after he had quit. At the moment it's in my hetero life mate's head about being that time to give up the cigarettes. I keep telling him that I'd help him out with what he wants and when he wants to do it. Just want to pay it forward. Good luck to all trying to give it up for good!", "Just wanna say this is a great community with awesome people. If you are prone to picking up hobbies this is an amazing one to have. I was one of those people once upon a time that thought vaping was absolutely ridiculous. I always said I'd rather quit smoking all together instead of picking up vaping. However, with an addictive personality it was extremely difficult for me to quit. When I started to research more about vaping I was convinced from all of the Reddit knowledge and gave it a go. I won't lie it took me a few tries to find a set up that worked for me to give up cigarettes all together but I finally found it. Currently on the Ijoy RDTA box. I first started with some Kangetech pens. Moved into an IPV400, migrated to a Wismec Reuleaux 200s. So I did spend some money in those first couple months but after research and playing around I have now found a constructive hobby in building and have quit smoking. After smoking for 9 years I am 100% done with cigarettes. I have been vaping for 5 months now and used to smoke minimum one pack per day. I have saved over $1000 dollars not buying cigarettes. Please give it a try. Start with an expensive set up and see where it goes. Even cutting back does a world of good. \n\nI hope everyone that sets a resolution is strong enough to hit their goal and if you don't succeed the first time around don't become discouraged. As stated it took me a few attempts. Then pens didn't really do it for me but it was a fantastic starting point! Everyone is different and it might work for you. \n\nGood luck and vape on!", 'How safe are the pens ?

Turns out it was because I had tried to go with a cheap-stick style vape, some flimsy $30 gadget.  It wasn't until I dropped $70 on a quality box-mod with adjustable voltage that it finally felt like not just a replacement for smoking, but an improvement.  To those who are interested in trying this, my advice is to be willing to eat the heavier up-front cost of a good device.\n\nBecause once you do...

Had no idea that this subreddit existed. I started vaping not too long ago as a primary hookah/shisha smoker.\n\nSo I guess if any of you visiting here were wondering about this, the electronic cigarette is also more ideal than a hookah/shisha. On average shisha contains around 10-15 mg of nicotine. When I started with the vape, I bought e-juices that are 3mg nicotine and found it very satisfying. The good thing is that it effectively cut down my nicotine intake. Overall it's less work and clean up too. I still love shisha but the vape is definitely more ideal. Also I believe you at least cut out the toxins that come from the coal and such.\n\nI started out with the joyetech starter, the one posted in the sidebar.

Bought a crappy setup from the equivalent of a mall kiosk, it broke after a week. Back to the fags. Daughter was born. HAVE to quit smoking. Came to /r/ecr, listened in on /u/chris2vaped doing a QnA where people were asking the questions that I wanted to ask. Invested $60 in a decent setup and here I am now. I relapsed once - on day 11 I had to have a cigarette. 2 puffs later it tasted so vile I tossed it and haven't had any since. Vaping isn't a magic bullet, you do still need a little willpower for the first couple of weeks - your body's addicted to all the other crap that's in cigarettes beside the nicotine and it takes a little while for that to fade out - but since then it's been plain sailing. Dropped the nicotine level from 18mg to 1mg, and hopefully I'll quit vaping soon too. \n\nDon't be afraid to ask anyone here questions. There's no such thing as a silly one.

Those results will encourage you to keep going, and before you know it, you\'ve gone weeks without a cigarette. \n\nThere\'s a lot of quit smoking apps out there that can help you count the days, and counting days can be important when you\'re quitting. I didn\'t stop counting days until it had been well over a year. I opened that app several times a day for weeks.

Personally, I did not. I kept my pack of cigarettes, because i knew the kind of anxiety that not having access to cigarettes caused me. I kept my last pack, and it was in plain sight in my bedroom. It was there if I absolutely needed it. Knowing that I could have a cigarette whenever I wanted actually helped me. When that craving hit me, I huffed on that goddamn vape like a fiend. But that craving would subside after 10 minutes of vaping hard, and I would completely forget about the cigarette. I tried one cigarette after a month of not having any - my cravings for them had subsided, I just wanted to see what I would think of them at that point. It was terrible, and I didn\'t finish it. I took a couple drags and put it out. It tasted bad, felt bad, and smelled bad. At that point, I knew I had won.\n\nWhen you first start, you might not know how long to vape in one go because it doesn\'t have the predestined time that a lit cigarette does. Don\'t be worried that you don\'t know when to stop. Just keep going until you feel like you\'ve had enough. Vape for an hour straight if you are having cravings. Just keep going until you\'ve had enough. You\'ll figure it out. \n\nSo I recommend finding a vaping solution that works for YOU... and at this point, it\'s not hard to find one!

They sell decent juice at really good prices. Before I started making my own this was the place I would go to buy the bulk of my juice. (I would recommend circus bear) As an added bonus they almost always throw in a free bottle or two, just because they are cool like that. 😎\n\n[Mt Baker Vapor](https://www.mtbakervapor.com/) \n\nThese guys sell fantastic juice at fantastic prices. They also sell flavorings which are very easy use if you are just staring DIY. I would personally recomend Moo Juice, its a very nice strawberry milk flavor.\n\n**To buy hardware:**\n\nIf you are juuuust starting out I would highly recommend an ego pen. They are what I started on and they both work and are extremely affordable. Right now [Vapes.com](https://www.vapes.com/shop/ego-ce4-vape-starter-kit-limited-time-offer/) is having a sale on a starter kit for $6. (Most places charge $20 or more for a pen, just to prey on the newcomers) \n\nFor a good starting device a step or two up from a pen I would recommend an [iStick 30w](https://www.misthub.com/product/eleaf-istick-30w-box-mod/). They currently are going for $26, but if you want to be able to use it you will need an atomizer. A good atomizer to start with is the [Aspire Atlantis 2](https://buyvaporizerpen.com/accessories/aspire-atlantis-2-sub-ohm?gclid=CjwKEAiAwZO0BRDvxs_1w-qFnhkSJABo10gge-z0mTnQAJkGTpWq6EaovqP5fRMtAp5GTEHC5nOvOxoCevHw_wcB). These are going for about 30 and are an extremely reliable, easy to use tank that holds around 3ml of juice. \n\nAnother fantastic starting device is the [Innokin Endura](http://www.myvaporstore.com/Innokin-Endura-T18-Starter-Kit-p/ink-end10.htm). This is a sleeker device that will only run you 30$ without having to buy a seperate atomizer. It features a 3ml tank and a 1000 mAh battery, which should last you a decent amount of time.\n\n**Choosing a nicotine strength:**\n\nMake sure to understand nicotine strength when ordering juice. (Keep in mind that in higher nicotine contents flavor will be harder to taste just due to the throat hit)\n\n0mg: No nicotine at all\n\n3mg: extremely light and almost unnoticeable in a pen, this works best with dripping atomizers or powerful tank setups.\n\n6mg: Pretty much the standard strength. Extremely light in a pen but not to strong in a dripper.\n\n12mg: Intermediate strength. Works decent in a pen and is bitey in dripper or tank. If you are quitting smoking I would recommend this if you are getting the iStick/atlantis setup I recommended earlier or something similar.\n\n18mg: Strong. Very bitey in a tank but can still be a decent choice depending on how long you have been smoking. This is pretty much the perfect strength in a pen.\n\n22+mg: Extremely strong. This is so strong to the point where it will mute the flavor of the juice due to its intense throat hit. Don't even bother running this in a tank or dripper unless you only plan on puffing. Mimics smoking really well in a pen though.\n\n30+mg: Anything this strong is either in a crappy gas station eCig or is nicotine base used in DIY eLiquid. Don't buy anything this strong unless you know what you are doing.\n\n**Understanding Vg/Pg ratios**\n\nMost juice is made with a vg/pg base.\n\nVg, or vegetable glycerin,  is a very viscous liquid that is metabolized into sugar. Due to its dense and viscous nature it creates a lot more vapor than pg. Pg, or propylene glycol, is a very runny substance that is found in many foods to preserve them and in asthma inhalers. It creates for more of a throat hit and carries flavor better. If you are running a pen I would recommend getting juice with a higher pg content than vg to taste the flavor a bit better, and if you are running a bigger device it would be better to get a higher vg content juice for less of a throat hit and more vapor production. \n\nIf these numbers are a bit confusing to you don't worry, most juice vendors have a way for you to select your nicotine strength and vg/pg ratio.\n\nTo recap, here is a helpful [infographic](http://imgur.com/a/THpUQ) that explains the parts of an e-cig and the ingredients to e-juice.\n\nWith all that being said I hope you have a wonderful mew year and vape on!\n", 'This is a good write up.\n\nHowever, I definitely think that the Atlantis is not that great of a starter tank by any means.

My cervical spine has straightened and is now bowing in the wrong direction. One disc has tri-compartmental stenosis which means the nerves are being compressed in 3 directions. I am the type of case that you hear about when someone just wakes up paralyzed. That risk is real for me. I need surgery. No doctor would touch me before because I smoked. The best case scenario is 20% fusion healing with a smoker. It goes up to almost 50% now that I quit. I need a tri-level fusion and that is a hugely complicated surgery with an obviously high failure rate. I do not have the Science to prove this only the various Surgeons who fired me because I smoked. They refused to do the surgery even though they told me I have no choice but to have it. I even had a Healer/Physical Therapist/Chiropractor refuse to take my case because he said he didn't think he should try to help me heal when I am undoing all of it by smoking. This man said this to me five years ago. It didn't even phase me other then crying my eyes out from the pain. I just kept on smoking. I was in real danger of death or a horrific quality of life but didn't even try to quit. Vaping has saved my life, very literally saved my life.\n\nIf anyone needs someone to talk to or recommendations on setups or even a freebie pack of juice, shoot me a PM. I have some flavors from Mt.

It's a leaf from a tree that grows in Southeast Asia. Surprisingly this treatment evolved in such a way that it contains chemicals in it that act like opiods found in poppy plants but work completely differently. Swallowing between 3-7 grams of this powdered leaf gives you a small boost in energy, mood enhancement and a bit of euphoria but most importantly pain relief. Also it is very inexpensive and legal. It is only marginally addictive and the withdrawal symptoms are mild at best. Speaking of withdrawal kratom can be used to severely dull withdrawal symptoms from a serious pain pill/heroin addiction. If you're interested check out /r/kratom or /r/kratomkorner . If you've been dealing with chronic pain for a long time and don't want to be forced to take hardcover pain pills it's worth looking into.

No, that\'s not a very heavy amount, and I never really felt "addicted" to it. A year later, I saw my friend using a vape. So I went out and bought one, because I could use it inside, not to quit smoking. For a while, that\'s what I did. I was using both of them. And eventually, I just decided that I liked vaping better.

hxf9wg|*|A ziplining contraption I created with 1000+ command blocks|*|['The amount of detail you put into this is astounding, well done man', 'Granted, the hoard of zombies I was running from ate me 20 minutes ago, but still very cool.', 'Not gonna lie, at first I didn’t actually think this was in game just because of how smooth it looks lol', 'Hypixel wants to know your location', 'Especially the sound, that will surely distract me from the fact that my 5+ year old Ipad would probably explode if I ever tried it.', 'That looks like a LOT of falling sand entities', "How in the heck, those are the best animations in game I've ever seen, didn't know you could do that type of stuff with command blocks that's insane. Well done!!!", 'With armor stands, you can do anything. They truly are one of the most underrated block in the game.', "I guess this is a better comment if any to generally cover how it was done. Generally is a bit vague in this case.\n\nBasically, virtually everything that composes of the cannon and the chair is an entity of some sort, each with different sizes for different needs. They are either a falling block riding an armor stand, a block in the head slot of an armor stand, a block in a minecart (with the display offset increased to hide the minecart from view), or an item in the hand slot of an armor stand.\n\nFalling blocks share the same size as regular blocks. It is necessary that it is riding on the armor stand, as teleporting a falling block is not always smooth. Blocks on armor stand heads and in their hands also work well, but their sizes are a bit of hindrance, and they are difficult to position and orient due to the nature of modifying the direction of each armor stand part. Blocks in minecarts are larger and can be rotated in unique directions, but they are slightly less responsive compared to armor stands, have collision boxes which can cause them to bump into other minecarts and cannot be rotated or teleported without their rotation resetting.\n\nTo make the entities move, you basically just use an /execute command to target the specific entity to teleport at specific timings. How Minecraft works with teleporting entities is that they do not just immediately appear in the desired destination; they quickly jump/glide there instead, giving a sense of smooth movement. To make parts rotate, you can use /data to modify the data of the entity to edit their Rotation NBT tag.\n\nFor the more 'mechanical' parts, I have the command blocks following the main teleporting command blocks to teleport it back a portion of the difference it moved (i.e. -0.1 blocks from 1 block), and then teleporting it, in the command blocks following those, forward the same distance. This gives the allusion of each component having some mass.\n\nTo sit on the chair itself, there is an invisible llama. My first choice was saddled pigs, as they were small as easy to work with. However, saddles do not turn invisible along with the mob, so other options such as striders were not possible. Minecarts, boats also proved a challenge due to their small detection boxes. Horses were too big and trying to ride one violently propelled me in a random direction due to the collision boxes of all the entities surrounding it.", 'Probably just setting the velocity of the entities at various timings but yeah it’s amazing', 'I kind of wish you could do that type of stuff in real life.', 'Wait, command blocks meaning this was done in vanilla?', 'The blocks tilting in an unnatural way, are thanks to armor stands', 'Yes.', "Fucking hell.
