The social effects is on point, I feel so ridiculous every time I vape in public, so I’d only do it in private. I’d go to the bathroom during work just to get some puffs in. Felt like a real crackhead, here’s hoping to quit being a slave to nicotine ✌️', 'How’d it go man?', 'How’s it going now?', 'crackhead for vaping for sure this is an addiction and a drug, i hope you got past this bro today i am quitting and weaning myself off of this nasty crap my lungs feel so jacked up from 3 years of this', 'Wanna know how I quit?\n\nI stopped. That’s it. No swap Ing in another habit like chewing gum, no cravings, no mood swings. \n\nPut the vape down, and don’t pick it back up - there’s nothing more than that.', "Yeah, it's really not hard to stop. \n\nI think people keep doing it because they have a mistaken impression that it helps them in some way, when in fact it doesn't.", 'My boss calls the vape a “Mouth Fedora” and it’s so fckn true', 'this is the best way to quit, never wanna vape again just based on that 😂', 'Why does this help so much? 🤣', "My story is similar to yours. Heavy all day vaper for 3.5 years. Clean for 5 months.\n\nI can't stress the first point enough. GET YOUR HEAD RIGHT. If you are not mentally ready to quit, rather take the time to get to that mental space.\n\nAfter the first 3 weeks, I can't say I have had any 'cravings' more just the 'agh, yeah, a vape would be pretty nice right now that vanishes before I entertain the thought.", 'How do I get my head right? I’ve been ready to quit, but perhaps my head isn’t right in the proper ways. I’m thinking writing down all the negative effects I experience so that I know what I’m avoiding. Can you elaborate on how you got your head right?', 'A little over 1 year ago, I stumbled upon your post. It inspired me to quit. December 4th 2020 was the last time I hit my vape. Appreciate your thorough post man and hope your staying strong! ❤️', 'that is very inspiring to hear, congratulations. Im about 8 years into vaping and im really trying to quit too', "That's amazing. 👏  Hope you are still quit, do you have any tips for when the overwhelming urge to vape occurs please? I've decided (about 40 mins ago) to quit (I've been vaping for 2 weeks after quitting for 3wks, following hypnotherapy). But today  something just snapped in my head. It makes me breathless, I don't exercise, I don't do anything for myself, just use vaping to avoid. Your experience as well as OPs, is inspiring and motivating me. 🙌", 'I noticed a lot of people never mentioned this about vaping, but for me (I have severe ADHD) it causes me to become agitated, irritable, anxious and I get really sweaty all the time! I’m not sure if it’s the fact that it’s making my adhd symptoms just that much worse, or my system is just so exhausted from the amount I vape (like a crackhead). I have been addicted to nicotine lozenges for about 8 years! So, I started vaping to maybe switch to and now I’m more addicted to the vaping 👎 I have been through many horrible withdrawals from major addictions but vaping is the most difficult habit to kick that I’ve ever started! It’s completely rediculous considering the longer I go without it, the better I feel and start to feel “normal again”. Unreal. I will save this post though because you are right about getting your head straight first, and that it literally has ZERO benefits as far as feeling good. I don’t get a nicotine rush unless I don’t vape for most of the day and then I just continue to chase the dragons tail and no benefit what so ever..', 'THIS!!', 'Thank you so much. I’m only 19 and I’ve been doing it on and off for 2 years. A lot of people at my job vape so it’s hard to avoid, but whenever I’ve quit it’s been so easy. Even when I stop or lose my vape for weeks because my adhd brain forgot where I put it, I’m okay. I’ve been seeing a lot of studies that prove how much inhaling vape chemicals can damage your bronchial tubes in your lungs beyond repair (even if you quit) and I just can’t get over seeing it. Everything you said is spot on. I think this really helped my resolve so thank you.', 'This post saved me! After reading this, I instantly bought Allen Carrs ‘how to quit vaping’ and have quit. The little monster is still calling out for nicotine every now and then but I’m so glad I can recognise it for what it is and be thankful I’m free!!', 'Its retardedly cheap tho is you Do everything yourself.\n\nAnd also the social effects you mentioned are stupid imo. Its viewed as smoking or a bit better. But true some people are retardedly blowing hzge ass clouds in the wrong places', 'Time is money too, dude. Do you really want to spend hours tinkering with stuff for the sole purpose of poisoning yourself? Even if it is was 100% free, why would you do that?', 'Wow, this is really going to help me. I’ve been juuling and buying disposable vapes since I was 16 (3 Years) and I’ve been wanting to quit for good. \n\nI’ve taken tolerance breaks of anywhere between 4 days-1 week. No withdrawals of any form. Therefore I tell myself, “Oh I’m not addicted, I can quit whenever I want, so why not just go buy one more.” \n\nWhy can’t I just stick to my word when I say this is my last one? I don’t get any forms of buzzes anymore unless I don’t have a form of nicotine for a day or two. \n\nThank you so much for this post, I needed to hear it from an internet stranger.', 'Did you quit?', 'I haven’t vaped in five days, which doesn’t sound like a lot in the grand scheme of things, but for me, a chain-vaper of around 4 years (I’m 19 now oops), it’s a great deal. I’ve unintentionally stopped after i broke my vape on a drunken night in town, then got a really bad flu this week, and now I’ve (for the first time) have had the urge to stop vaping. Instead of setting up a certain time and date to quit, I think it’s just better to randomly stop one day and just keep it up. The problem is the associations that I have with vaping, as in listening to music, on drives, going to bars and clubbing all while vaping, but it will hopefully diminish within time. Hoping all of us on this sub reddit, successfully quit !', 'hows it going?', 'I want to quit really bad as I’ve been having minor chest pain and I don’t know if anyone else experienced this while vaping but that’s my main motive to quit I just want to feel healthy again along with I feel like it fuels my anxiety. This was super helpful', "Same. It makes my chest tight, I'm breathless, no energy, and I get chest pain. For these reasons alone I want to quit. So that I can exercise and walk easily again.", "I'm 21 and I've been using it for 4 years. I feel like my whole personality has changed for the worse since I started. However I am still fairly young, it could've just been me maturing. Anyhow, I tried quitting once and it was very hard. I became easily irritated and just felt kind of crappy after the 2nd day. But I've noticed a difference in my lungs over time and its harder to get physically active because of it. I run out of breath easier and quicker. I'm going to try and quit again starting now. Hopefully this will help motivate me!", 'I’m coming back to this comment. It’s been 6 months. I actually lost my vape then after just buying a new one for the week and was pissed when I couldn’t find it after only a couple days. I saw how it made me look crazy as I literally tore my house upside down just to clean it up and tear it down again because I “really” needed it. I live in a college town so it’s hard when you see the majority of the population just smoking in public with no concern but I read your post and step 1 alone helps me to stay on track. I’ll check back in another 6 months. Wish me luck', '17, causing me issues with my family and ill be off to college soon and really dont wanna bring it with me. We all gonna make it brah', 'i’ve been vaping since i was like 13, and i have a lot of health issues(unrelated) that it does not help at all. i was in the shower and my chest started to hurt so i got out in a hurry to dry off and tried to breathe slowly. i then at that moment realized there’s no reason on Earth for me to be vaping. todays day number 1 and im hoping its for good this time 😌', 'How’s it going? I’m on day one wishing you the best of luck', 'I am 73.  I smoked cigarettes almost 20 years and then started vaping.  And yes, it was better than tobacco.  But it is NOT good.  I am quitting vaping because I am SCARED of it and what it is doing to me. Also, I am always self-conscious because I have to excuse myself and "go vape.  I am tired of it.  Today I am using a nicotine lozenge.  Still struggling not to vape.  I have a cough I want to get rid of. It started about 10 days ago.  I say, look to the positive.

Hate how much I've been spending with this shit but couldn't really break the habit. I lost my vapes a few times during drunk nights and would always end up buying a new one. That cycle started making me feel guilty and defeated. I finally lost it again at a wedding this weekend.. guess it's a sign from the universe to try harder. Wish me luck on this journey yall.", "Pretty much in the same exact position. I have broken and lost so many vapes and spent way too much money on the habit. Smoker 2005-2013 and vaping since. I'm sick of how much control it has over me. For example, if I don't know where my vape is I start freaking out and get anxious until I find it. I have been talking about quitting for a while now and the physical withdrawals don't scare me as much as the psychological addiction and oral fixation. Best of luck to you!! I'll be on the same journey.  \n\n\nedit: grammar  \nwhich, i'm sure, is still really bad", 'I have POTS which is condition where my brain doesn’t tell my blood vessels to constrict when i change positions (standing up, rolling over, sitting straight) so my daily live quality is equivalent to someone in heart failure. I didn’t realize nic constricts blood vessels and didn’t put two and two together that my POTS symptoms (super high hr, passing out, nausea, sweating, etc) disappearing after starting vaping was bc of my unhealthy habit😭 i’m so sad i thought I grew out of it:( But I want to quit after starting a few months ago bc i’m now starting to get bad acid reflux and a cough so here i am', "I like your optimism there and honestly I know people who've kicked it this way and I envy them just like you in a way. For me I was a smoker and got pushed towards vaping as a harm reduction thing. I couldn't quit smoking and I can't quit vaping, I'm healthier then i was as a smoker, my longs are better but my heart feels the nicotine. I'm 26 and it scares me to think about doing this when I'm in my 30s and onward. Today I just switched from 12 (Freebase) to 3. I'm hoping that 3 will get me through the fixation part, I don't even like the nicotine high anymore but I just need that thing in my hands.

You can definitely quit if you've done it before, good luck man.", 'I’ve been vaping since I was 12. I’m 16 now and really trying to quit. I’ve been vaping a lot more than usual lately and noticed that my hands are purple a lot of the time, not sure if that’s related. I want to quit so bad, but I look forward to vaping constantly.

Let's see how it goes!", "You know the most fucked up part of quitting? It has been genuinely harder than quitting cigarettes. By a solid margin. Quitting cigarettes you have so much going for you. You can't do it inside, it doesn't taste good (unless it's first thing in the morning with black coffee. I'll always miss that). It smells like shit, and makes you smell like shit too.\nSo quitting cigarettes was easy (for me at least).\nBut vaping, I've quit three times in the last 7 years. The longest attempt lasted a little over 6 months. But it keeps drawing me back in. It's just too easy, and too convenient.\nI'm on my fourth go at quitting right now, and I'm just shy of a week in. Kicking the nicotine addiction is the easy part. If you get past day three, you're in the clear. The actual hard part is the addiction to that feeling of bringing something to your mouth, and inhaling.

I currently vape but trying to quit, but at a MAXIMUM I only spend $35 a month, which is only $420 a year and $2.1k every 5 years. That doesn’t seem very bad at all, not compared to the 3 grand I spent on cigarettes every year. \nAlso, if you plan on quitting vaping you in fact don’t have to go through the withdrawals, just use gum and/or patches. You’d still have craving though and would have to kick the physical addiction of vaping. Vaping is not bad for you in every way, that’s just not true, it’s 98% safer than cigarettes and will possibly take a year off your life instead of 30 years. Vaping is practically harmless in comparison. But if you didn’t start vaping to get off cigarettes, then I agree and you should quit, there’s no reason for someone to start vaping, but if you’re going to start smoking or start vaping, I’d lead you to vaping 10 out of 10 times', "> Compared to other drugs like alcohol, the physical aspect of nicotine withdrawal is pretty trivial - barely noticeable, actually. \n\nSay that to my face while I'm in this withdrawal-induced blind rage.", 'Actually, nicotine dependency is compared to heroin addiction.', 'does a toothpick in the mouth work?', 'Found this at the top of all time since I’m looking for motivation to quit. How do you feel now a year or so later?', 'A lot better… vaping sucks!', 'Boobies!', 'Saving this 💯', 'One tip I can easily recommend is that if you’re gonna quit vaping, lay off on alcohol until you know you’re officially done with the vape. I’m currently gonna try to start today because everything OP put in this post is so true. After the first morning buzz, it just feels like you’re simply preventing withdrawal by constantly hitting it without the effect of any buzz\n\nIf I could simply vape and put it down and go own with my day I would but it’s impossible for me to not hit the damn thing all fucking day so yeah I’m just gonna chuck my vape in the trash and just start wether I like it or not. Only way to do it.', 'I want to quit so badly, been vaping for around 3 years now, and I started all because it says it reduces anxiety. But this shit is so bad for me, is it a better idea to quit on a weekend so I can deal with the withdrawal then? Or should I be fine going cold turkey from 50mg disposables while I work?', "I think the biggest thing is to not be around other people who are vaping/smoking while you're doing the 2-3 day withdrawal.

It raises your blood sugar. I wondered why my blood sugars remained High even after not eating for a long time.

I do the Mints to get over sucking on something lol and then quit cold turkey you think my kidney issues I got from vaping would stop me but nope. Good luck everyone', 'I’m gonna try strong mint gum for the oral fixation and positive and negative thinking to combat the craving. Use to think it calmed me down, it does the opposite. Circulation is so bad I’m freezing at 74 degrees. Have to take a hot bath multiple times a day. Gonna use epsom salt to detox. It’s not impossible people. It’s all mental, and idk if my notifications are on for reply’s but I’ll try to report back to let y’all know if it worked. It also suppresses appetite so make sure to eat and drink some of a celcuis to combat tiredness and try to get a sleep med like seroquel or trazodone to fight the anxiety and insomnia. If you can get clonidine for blood pressure, it works wonders. Mediate the withdraw as much as possible and don’t forget quitting is making you feel better.

So far i havent been eating more though", 'You’re most welcome, I’m glad that it was helpful! \n\nRe weight gain, I am also very vain so I totally get it. I was so worried about this. In truth I did put on a little weight (others didn’t notice it but I’ve always been very petite, so I did) as I was eating so much just to fill that horrible empty feeling. I didn’t weigh myself but I could just tell by looking in the mirror that my body was a bit different looking. \n\nWhat helped me though was really upping my exercise routine - both to improve my lung health after trashing my poor little lungs for so many years, and to balance out the additional calories. Exercise has been my single biggest saviour in this whole journey. \n\nI’m now 138 days vape free and my body is the best it’s ever been as I’m working out so much more than I ever did as a smoker/vaper. \n\nI would really encourage you not to give up if you gain a little weight. Quitting is so, so worth it and you can always lose the weight once you’re out the other side, or do what I did - up your exercise routine and it should balance out. \n\nNothing is more important than ditching the nic!', 'wow all of these hit so close to home!!! i’m 6 days in with no vape, feels amazing.', 'Well done!

I went through a very similar experience. Went a month cold turkey off of vaping. Those first couple of days kind of suck, but after the initial hump I felt a lot better, and as the days went on my cravings got less and less. After that month I was going to watch football with some friends. A couple of them vape, and I thought “you know what, I’ll just buy a disposable to use while I’m hanging out with them, and then I’ll get rid of it afterwards.” Then I decided maybe I could just keep it, and only use it while I’m hanging out with them. Now, I’m back to vaping just to feel “normal” again. \n\nI literally just bought a 4 pack of pods, and felt like shit for doing it. I typed in quitvaping into Reddit figuring there’s a subreddit for it, and this is the first post I clicked on.

As of now, 11/2/2022 at 6:00pm. I've taken the first step in beginning my journey to quit vaping. How did I get here? Well it started with the very last bottle of juice. Not the good stuff juice. That bottle you find hidden away long ago cause you didn't like it at the time. Desperate to finally end the vape cycle but still hooked. That only bottle left to ease the crave. Down to the last coil that is nearing burnt. Holding onto the mod that you've owned for the last 4 years that no longer keeps the charge. All arrows pointing to either you crack to buy new setup or you hold your ground on quitting. Let's be honest here. A new setup can be pricey. A new mod. New coils. New bottles of juice. Everything under the sun is expensive right now. I can't justify spending money on an addiction that isn't helping me and is making life actually worse. Money that can go towards better things in my life. On top of that. I know vaping isn't good for my health. I know it's affecting my gums and teeth. Which is another motivation to quit. I have to do this for my health. I've been vaping for the last 8-9 years. Before the vape I smoked cigarettes. I know at one point in my life I didn't smoke cigarettes nor vaped. I know I can be free from it. I have to try my best to break the habits. If anyone has any advice that would be appreciated. I was told eating sunflower seeds can help ease craving. I'm really dead serious about quitting. I'm also concerned. I live with others who vape. I'm worried seeing them vape will trigger me back into it. Hearing the vape. Smelling and seeing the clouds. This is probably the biggest factor of the challenge. I can't really escape the vape around me right now. I know this is going to be hard and it's going to suck. I'm going to hold myself accountable each day and try to stay positive. Remind myself why I'm doing this. How this is going to benefit me going forward.", 'Sunflower seeds are sold either in the shell or as shelled kernels. Those still in the shell are commonly eaten by cracking them with your teeth, then spitting out the shell — which shouldn’t be eaten. These seeds are a particularly popular snack at baseball games and other outdoor sports games.', "I too quit 11/2/22 at 6:00. I know because I decided to throw my disposable along with my delta-8 vape as well out of my car window on my way home last night. I am literally writing this from a gas station parking lot that I've been sitting in for at least 20 minutes now. Trying to tell myself not to go in. After reading this post and now your comment I think I'll go home. But I know it won't be long until I'm back here, trying to make the same decision again. Maybe together we can do it. I'm just so angry and irritable right now. I don't see how I can make it honestly.", 'Saved. Unbelievable. Day 114 was heavily considering going back, but I’m going to hold off.

Throughout the 7 or so years of vaping, it was mainly weekly use. Only on vacations would I vape daily.

Before last year, I was in the process of quitting so I was doing it every few months. Eventually I had enough and wanted to change. The first few weeks were definitely the worse. Mood problems, anxiety, some insomnia, but I did other activities like working out and spending time outside to push through. At around the 3 month mark I finally started to feel OK again.

Couldn't agree more.\n\nI had the same experience as you, vaped for 5+ years, quit after feeling the way you've described and listening to Allan Carr's book. I'm now 142 days 'nic free'.\n\nFull context - I have relapsed a few times on weekends/nights out. But now that I've seen the absolute slavery of dependence for what it is, I've had zero desire to go back to full daily use after any relapses.\n\nIt's a mentality shift, and it sounds like you've got it! Congrats on quitting.", 'I relapsed after 68 days after drinking beer and didn’t have too much of a hard time carrying on as usual the next day too. I’m not sure I seen it as a “I’m in control of nicotine it’s not in control of me” moment though. Ultimately I still smoked that night, to me it opened my eyes to how addictive it truly is. I still risked it all by smoking, any time I relapse I risk losing it all. If I was truly in control I’d just not smoke ever, I wouldn’t play with fire and push my luck. That’s my opinion and how I look at my relapse anyway.', 'I’ve listened to that book as well and it REALLY helped me. I’m day 8 now and I honestly want to rip my head off cause I can’t focus. the thoughts in my head are an absolute mess.', "Thanks for sharing this.  It reminds me alot of the olden days.  Although probably too young to remember, there was a time when we smoked EVERYWHERE, when secondhand smoke concerns weren't yet a concern.  Smoking was the norm inside everyone's house.  We smoked in bed, at work, in restaurants, concerts, football games, while pushing a cart and shopping in the grocery store.  I made 7 cold war submarine patrols and at least half the crew smoked.  About the only place smoking wasn't permitted was when pumping gas. \n\nThe more controls society imposed, the less smokers were able to smoke, the more nicotine deprived they became, with nicotine tolerance levels (cigs per day) ever so gradually declining, except for the self-employed or few jobs that allowed smoking.  My own boss and smoking three packs-a-day, the day before I quit I was lighting a new one every 15 minutes from dusk to dawn, a pack for the morning, the 2nd by noon and the 3rd by dinner.\n\nAs for nicotine intake comparisons, while relatively easy for science to establish that the average smoker introduces roughly 1mg of nicotine per cigarette smoked and that the average smoker smokes 15 cigs per day, as you note, vaping has no defined stopping point.  On here you read about folks holding their vape in their hand as they sleep and an entire ElfBar being consumed in a day.\n\nWith so many juice nicotine concentration variations, it makes intake comparisons a nightmare.   Instead, we [see vaping studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7668279/) focus on factors such as the average number of puffs per day (365 for the average POD/tank user), weekly e-liquid consumption (median: 32.5 mL/week), and the nicotine concentration vaped (median: 3 mg/mL).", 'I have seen so many of your comments, and would like to thank you so much for imparting your wisdom on all of us.

It's pretty awesome and I hope you can stick to it.", 'Absolutely. This is embarrassing but I switched back to cigarettes before quitting because cigarettes force me to slow down the intake and I become disgusted with them and the smell and the feeling. The first few days back on cigarettes, I was literally going through withdrawal while still smoking as many as I wanted. My body had to adjust back to good ole fashioned tar-in-the-lungs nicotine rather than the cross-the-blood-brain-barrier nicotine salt chinese space drugs they put in Elf Bars.

It was good to make it less convenient.   \n\n\nNot making any recommendations here because everyone is different, but this helped me.', 'This makes a ton of sense.

Reading a book. Taking a bath.

I got through the worst by chugging water or eating every time I got a craving, you do start to realize that most cravings are your body wanting food or water, not always nicotine. Hard candy specifically lollipops or jolly ranchers. Also making hot tea, specifically chai, camomile, ginger/lemon, was soothing during cravings. Also don’t feel bad about just sleeping forever, I felt like it took a week for all the juice to work out of my system and I was super fatigued while quitting, exercise helped some to bring energy up… just light cardio and working outside. Keep it up, stay distracted!', 'How’s quitting going for you now? I haven’t vaped in a couple months but still using the cessation products like crazy 😵\u200d💫😵\u200d💫😵\u200d💫', 'This really hit close to home']
mxhh6h|*|Yes, the cravings go away completely. Reporting back 6 months after quitting.|*|['I’m 78 days vape free. Vaping no longer crosses my mind. I feel so free 😁. Thank you for your post!', "Isn't it so much better on the other side? Congrats!", '[deleted]', 'When I was quitting, I frequently googled this too. Because the first several hours after quitting, my brain just pulsatied intense cravings - they were so persistent and intrusive it honestly felt like I was going crazy and I\'d never feel good ever again for the rest of my life.\n\nThis is why my quit attempts kept failing. I just wanted that feeling to end, so I would get 10-16 hours and fall apart and use again to get that feeling of relief....\n\nI\'m now at day 20 nicotine free. And I hardly ever feel cravings. They are there, but unobtrusive, thoughts. "I want that." This quit was successful, because I handled my cravings differently.\n\nInstead of focusing on how shitty I felt, I journaled and documented every single time I felt ok, when I didn\'t feel absolutely awful. On day one I had a handful of good moments. Day 2 they were more frequent. Day 3 more frequent and lasted longer... By Day 8 I had a few hours where was I was ok, and hadn\'t had a single intrusive thought. Day 12, my cravings had down graded in intensity to the point where there were unrecognizable from day one.', 'No worries! I remember going crazy over this too.', 'Here is where I am. I was a cigar smoker and cigarette chipper for 20 years. Never got addicted. I enjoyed tobacco but I did it on my own terms. Went for weeks or months without a regular smoke and never felt the obsession to have it, yet truly enjoyed every puff when I did.\n\nVaping came along and totally changed the game. I could have it anytime, anywhere without smell or social ostracism. Based on the convenience, I became addicted.\n\nNow one month off of vape and snus, I obsess about tobacco. I miss the taste and experience. I am afraid if I try to chip again, it will be different this time based on my previous addiction.', "Are you still nic free? \n\nI'm the same and got addicted when I was 30. Now I'm worried I can never go back to not craving it at all", "It almost certainly will be different. I highly recommend you read The Easy Way to Quit Smoking by Allen Carr because he touches on your exact situation. It gets recommended a lot and for good reason. I'm a pretty skeptical person in general so I wasn't expecting the book to work but it definitely helped.", 'I’ve quit nicotine before and I agree that the day to day cravings go away 100%. only thing was whenever I would see someone smoking a cig in a movie or one of my friends vaping I would get an urge months after the fact.', "I recommended the book 'The Easy Way to Quit Smoking' by Allen Carr to someone else in the thread but it talks about this situation too. I don't get cravings by watching other people vape/smoke at all now, I just feel pity because I know 99% of them want to quit but can't. I think some people just forget how miserable the whole experience was once they're a few months out of it, but if you commit it to memory before you quit it's a ton easier.", "I'm 4 months clean after vaping for 3 years, still get infrequent but intense cravings. My aunt has been off cigs for 20 years and still wants them. Varies by person.", "What lingering effects remained after the first month?\n\nI'm almost at 30 days and I'm wondering if the occasional cravings & headaches will go away.", "I still had cravings a few times a week, especially after dinner, up until 6-8 weeks. They just became less frequent as time went on and then disappeared around then. You're halfway there. They will go away, don't worry.\n\nWanted to add: The first 2 weeks for me were very tough. I couldn't think straight at all and felt nauseous all the time. I had to take a couple days off from classes because I couldn't concentrate. I was worried that the brain fog wouldn't go away but it completely did after the 1 month mark.", "I'm so excited for the time I'll never have cravings. I'm 2 months in right now and my cravings aren't strong, but I just want to forget about nicotine completely.", 'Yup, I can attest to this. After about a week when I quit before it went away, maybe even less than that. Sure the first few days suck, but after that it really does go away. Some people do cave in, but when I’ve caved before it’s honestly more of the “I wonder what it would feel like if I hit a vape again” rather than “I’m craving so much, I gotta get a hit”.', 'Thanks for this, this has actually been something I’ve been wondering because I’m getting ready to quit. Can’t wait till I’m at that point where nic addiction is in the past lol', "That's great for you, but it's different for every person. However, after 6 months, the vast majority of people will not have any serious day to day cravings.\n\nI've just passed the 6 months milestone, and it was only the first month that was hard. Actually, I'd say I had to avoid certain social situations for 3 months to avoid temptation. But now 6 months in I'm fine with that. Even when I'm drinking around people smoking, I don't really feel the urge to smoke.  \n\n\nIn fact my vape cravings have completely disappeared, but I do occasionally get pangs of desire for a cigarette. It's very manageable though.", 'Yes I quit for 6 months then I just hit one bc it was there and I forgot what it was like. Stupid decision, now i’m 15 days off nicotine and I had to go through it all again', '3 weeks in next Monday and I’m definitely getting there.  The cravings have been much easier to manage and I don’t feel as nervous that I’ll cave in', "The first two weeks for me were rough. I remember obsessively googling other peoples' quitting stories and how long cravings/headaches would last. I'm 100% sure that if I hadn't thrown out my juul I would have caved. A few weeks after that it was like a night and day difference. If you can get this far, the rest is a piece of cake.", "Congratulations! Keep going! When do the withdrawals go away? I'm on day 5. I've quit before but wasn't successful in the past. Now I have no desire to go back. Not after these withdrawals. I have a foggy brain and feel like I can't English lol.", "I can only speak for myself but pretty much all of the brain fog/headaches were gone at the 6-8 week mark. I actually had a really hard time with withdrawals for the first two weeks but I'm so glad I pushed through.", 'So when I quit, at the end of week 1, I suffered from really bad nausea. Now currently on day 33 the last couple of days the nausea has come back, it’s a lot lighter and definitely think it’s due to quitting vaping. Any advice? Suffer anything similar?', "It's normal to still have some withdrawals around then. See how you feel in 2 weeks, that's around when mine went to 0. Remember it's different for everyone."]
