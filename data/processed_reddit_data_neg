How I quit vaping, and you can too.|*|['Saved this post to keep reading every time I have cravings. The social effects is on point, I feel so ridiculous every time I vape in public, so I’d only do it in private. I’d go to the bathroom during work just to get some puffs in. Felt like a real crackhead, here’s hoping to quit being a slave to nicotine ✌️', 'crackhead for vaping for sure this is an addiction and a drug, i hope you got past this bro today i am quitting and weaning myself off of this nasty crap my lungs feel so jacked up from 3 years of this', 'Wanna know how I quit?\n\nI stopped. That’s it. No swap Ing in another habit like chewing gum, no cravings, no mood swings. \n\nPut the vape down, and don’t pick it back up - there’s nothing more than that.', 'My boss calls the vape a “Mouth Fedora” and it’s so fckn true', 'this is the best way to quit, never wanna vape again just based on that 😂', "My story is similar to yours. Heavy all day vaper for 3.5 years. Clean for 5 months.\n\nI can't stress the first point enough. GET YOUR HEAD RIGHT. If you are not mentally ready to quit, rather take the time to get to that mental space.\n\nAfter the first 3 weeks, I can't say I have had any 'cravings' more just the 'agh, yeah, a vape would be pretty nice right now that vanishes before I entertain the thought.", 'A little over 1 year ago, I stumbled upon your post. It inspired me to quit. December 4th 2020 was the last time I hit my vape. Appreciate your thorough post man and hope your staying strong! ❤️', 'that is very inspiring to hear, congratulations. Im about 8 years into vaping and im really trying to quit too', "That's amazing. 👏  Hope you are still quit, do you have any tips for when the overwhelming urge to vape occurs please? I've decided (about 40 mins ago) to quit (I've been vaping for 2 weeks after quitting for 3wks, following hypnotherapy). But today  something just snapped in my head. It makes me breathless, I don't exercise, I don't do anything for myself, just use vaping to avoid. Your experience as well as OPs, is inspiring and motivating me. 🙌", 'I noticed a lot of people never mentioned this about vaping, but for me (I have severe ADHD) it causes me to become agitated, irritable, anxious and I get really sweaty all the time! I’m not sure if it’s the fact that it’s making my adhd symptoms just that much worse, or my system is just so exhausted from the amount I vape (like a crackhead). I have been addicted to nicotine lozenges for about 8 years! So, I started vaping to maybe switch to and now I’m more addicted to the vaping 👎 I have been through many horrible withdrawals from major addictions but vaping is the most difficult habit to kick that I’ve ever started! It’s completely rediculous considering the longer I go without it, the better I feel and start to feel “normal again”. Unreal. I will save this post though because you are right about getting your head straight first, and that it literally has ZERO benefits as far as feeling good. I don’t get a nicotine rush unless I don’t vape for most of the day and then I just continue to chase the dragons tail and no benefit what so ever..', 'Thank you so much. I’m only 19 and I’ve been doing it on and off for 2 years. A lot of people at my job vape so it’s hard to avoid, but whenever I’ve quit it’s been so easy. Even when I stop or lose my vape for weeks because my adhd brain forgot where I put it, I’m okay. I’ve been seeing a lot of studies that prove how much inhaling vape chemicals can damage your bronchial tubes in your lungs beyond repair (even if you quit) and I just can’t get over seeing it. Everything you said is spot on. I think this really helped my resolve so thank you.', 'This post saved me! After reading this, I instantly bought Allen Carrs ‘how to quit vaping’ and have quit. The little monster is still calling out for nicotine every now and then but I’m so glad I can recognise it for what it is and be thankful I’m free!!', 'Its retardedly cheap tho is you Do everything yourself.\n\nAnd also the social effects you mentioned are stupid imo. Its viewed as smoking or a bit better. But true some people are retardedly blowing hzge ass clouds in the wrong places', 'Wow, this is really going to help me. I’ve been juuling and buying disposable vapes since I was 16 (3 Years) and I’ve been wanting to quit for good. \n\nI’ve taken tolerance breaks of anywhere between 4 days-1 week. No withdrawals of any form. Therefore I tell myself, “Oh I’m not addicted, I can quit whenever I want, so why not just go buy one more.” \n\nWhy can’t I just stick to my word when I say this is my last one? I don’t get any forms of buzzes anymore unless I don’t have a form of nicotine for a day or two. \n\nThank you so much for this post, I needed to hear it from an internet stranger.', 'I haven’t vaped in five days, which doesn’t sound like a lot in the grand scheme of things, but for me, a chain-vaper of around 4 years (I’m 19 now oops), it’s a great deal. I’ve unintentionally stopped after i broke my vape on a drunken night in town, then got a really bad flu this week, and now I’ve (for the first time) have had the urge to stop vaping. Instead of setting up a certain time and date to quit, I think it’s just better to randomly stop one day and just keep it up. The problem is the associations that I have with vaping, as in listening to music, on drives, going to bars and clubbing all while vaping, but it will hopefully diminish within time. Hoping all of us on this sub reddit, successfully quit !', 'I want to quit really bad as I’ve been having minor chest pain and I don’t know if anyone else experienced this while vaping but that’s my main motive to quit I just want to feel healthy again along with I feel like it fuels my anxiety. This was super helpful', 'I’m coming back to this comment. It’s been 6 months. I actually lost my vape then after just buying a new one for the week and was pissed when I couldn’t find it after only a couple days. I saw how it made me look crazy as I literally tore my house upside down just to clean it up and tear it down again because I “really” needed it. I live in a college town so it’s hard when you see the majority of the population just smoking in public with no concern but I read your post and step 1 alone helps me to stay on track. I’ll check back in another 6 months.

I have a cough I want to get rid of. It started about 10 days ago.  I say, look to the positive.  Hearing about young people quitting helps me.  What do I have to gain?

Let's see how it goes!", "You know the most fucked up part of quitting? It has been genuinely harder than quitting cigarettes. By a solid margin. Quitting cigarettes you have so much going for you. You can't do it inside, it doesn't taste good (unless it's first thing in the morning with black coffee. I'll always miss that). It smells like shit, and makes you smell like shit too.\nSo quitting cigarettes was easy (for me at least).\nBut vaping, I've quit three times in the last 7 years. The longest attempt lasted a little over 6 months. But it keeps drawing me back in. It's just too easy, and too convenient.\nI'm on my fourth go at quitting right now, and I'm just shy of a week in. Kicking the nicotine addiction is the easy part. If you get past day three, you're in the clear. The actual hard part is the addiction to that feeling of bringing something to your mouth, and inhaling. In my experience, it never goes away, you just think about it less and less over time.\n\nGood luck to you all, and hopefully time number four is the final for me 🤙", 'Jesus.. I currently vape but trying to quit, but at a MAXIMUM I only spend $35 a month, which is only $420 a year and $2.1k every 5 years. That doesn’t seem very bad at all, not compared to the 3 grand I spent on cigarettes every year. \nAlso, if you plan on quitting vaping you in fact don’t have to go through the withdrawals, just use gum and/or patches. You’d still have craving though and would have to kick the physical addiction of vaping. Vaping is not bad for you in every way, that’s just not true, it’s 98% safer than cigarettes and will possibly take a year off your life instead of 30 years. Vaping is practically harmless in comparison. But if you didn’t start vaping to get off cigarettes, then I agree and you should quit, there’s no reason for someone to start vaping, but if you’re going to start smoking or start vaping, I’d lead you to vaping 10 out of 10 times', 'A lot better… vaping sucks!', 'One tip I can easily recommend is that if you’re gonna quit vaping, lay off on alcohol until you know you’re officially done with the vape. I’m currently gonna try to start today because everything OP put in this post is so true. After the first morning buzz, it just feels like you’re simply preventing withdrawal by constantly hitting it without the effect of any buzz\n\nIf I could simply vape and put it down and go own with my day I would but it’s impossible for me to not hit the damn thing all fucking day so yeah I’m just gonna chuck my vape in the trash and just start wether I like it or not. Only way to do it.', 'I want to quit so badly, been vaping for around 3 years now, and I started all because it says it reduces anxiety.

Or should I be fine going cold turkey from 50mg disposables while I work?', "I think the biggest thing is to not be around other people who are vaping/smoking while you're doing the 2-3 day withdrawal.

I know I will', "Maybe this can help some people  I know it's regarding smoking but can do the same for vaping maybe \n\n URL \n\nWhat I've done starting today is have a list of reasons why I want to stop on the front page of my phone  not the lock screen . Let's see how it goes ", "You know the most fucked up part of quitting  It has been genuinely harder than quitting cigarettes. By a solid margin. Quitting cigarettes you have so much going for you. You can't do it inside, it doesn't taste good  unless it's first thing in the morning with black coffee. I'll always miss that . It smells like shit, and makes you smell like shit too.\nSo quitting cigarettes was easy  for me at least .\nBut vaping, I've quit three times in the last  years. The longest attempt lasted a little over  months. But it keeps drawing me back in. It's just too easy, and too convenient.\nI'm on my fourth go at quitting right now, and I'm just shy of a week in. Kicking the nicotine addiction is the easy part. If you get past day three, you're in the clear. The actual hard part is the addiction to that feeling of bringing something to your mouth, and inhaling. In my experience, it never goes away, you just think about it less and less over time.\n\nGood luck to you all, and hopefully time number four is the final for me  ", 'Jesus.. I currently vape but trying to quit, but at a MAXIMUM I only spend   a month, which is only   a year and  .1k every  years. That doesn t seem very bad at all, not compared to the  grand I spent on cigarettes every year. \nAlso, if you plan on quitting vaping you in fact don t have to go through the withdrawals, just use gum and or patches. You d still have craving though and would have to kick the physical addiction of vaping. Vaping is not bad for you in every way, that s just not true, it s   safer than cigarettes and will possibly take a year off your life instead of  years. Vaping is practically harmless in comparison. But if you didn t start vaping to get off cigarettes, then I agree and you should quit, there s no reason for someone to start vaping, but if you re going to start smoking or start vaping, I d lead you to vaping  out of  times', 'A lot better  vaping sucks ', 'One tip I can easily recommend is that if you re gonna quit vaping, lay off on alcohol until you know you re officially done with the vape. I m currently gonna try to start today because everything OP put in this post is so true. After the first morning buzz, it just feels like you re simply preventing withdrawal by constantly hitting it without the effect of any buzz\n\nIf I could simply vape and put it down and go own with my day I would but it s impossible for me to not hit the damn thing all fucking day so yeah I m just gonna chuck my vape in the trash and just start wether I like it or not. Only way to do it.', 'I want to quit so badly, been vaping for around  years now, and I started all because it says it reduces anxiety. But this shit is so bad for me, is it a better idea to quit on a weekend so I can deal with the withdrawal then  Or should I be fine going cold turkey from 50mg disposables while I work ', "I think the biggest thing is to not be around other people who are vaping smoking while you're doing the   day withdrawal. If your coworkers don't vape, I'd quit during the week just because you'll be busy and have work to take your mind off it.", "I work in a vape shop  '  I am going to attempt to stop Thursday night throw it all away and deal with the shit show.", 'I used the nicorate mints before it worked but vaping is hard u can do it anywhere at anytime. I do the Mints to get over sucking on something lol and then quit cold turkey you think my kidney issues I got from vaping would stop me but nope. Good luck everyone', "I'm going to try to quit today. Actually I have been trying to quit for weeks but my husband vapes which makes things so much harder", "Thanks for the advice  I am currently addicted and have been vaping since  in college... I just did an estimate and I am spending   per month on this shit. Its absurdly expensive since I live in PA and we have the   vapor tax which doesn't help at all... I am gonna quit cold turkey just like you and see how it all plays out", 'I am attempting to go cold Turkey today. I am only  hours in and all I can think about is hitting my vape. I know it is not good for me and there are even times when smoking it makes me feel like shit but it gives me this false sense of enjoyment that seems irreplaceable in short increments.

Before last year, I was in the process of quitting so I was doing it every few months. Eventually I had enough and wanted to change. The first few weeks were definitely the worse. Mood problems, anxiety, some insomnia, but I did other activities like working out and spending time outside to push through. At around the 3 month mark I finally started to feel OK again.

Anyone else think that vaping is a whole different paradigm of nicotine addiction and its effects?|*|["Great post mate. Very well said. Couldn't agree more.\n\nI had the same experience as you, vaped for 5+ years, quit after feeling the way you've described and listening to Allan Carr's book. I'm now 142 days 'nic free'.\n\nFull context - I have relapsed a few times on weekends/nights out. But now that I've seen the absolute slavery of dependence for what it is, I've had zero desire to go back to full daily use after any relapses.\n\nIt's a mentality shift, and it sounds like you've got it! Congrats on quitting.", 'I relapsed after 68 days after drinking beer and didn’t have too much of a hard time carrying on as usual the next day too. I’m not sure I seen it as a “I’m in control of nicotine it’s not in control of me” moment though. Ultimately I still smoked that night, to me it opened my eyes to how addictive it truly is. I still risked it all by smoking, any time I relapse I risk losing it all. If I was truly in control I’d just not smoke ever, I wouldn’t play with fire and push my luck. That’s my opinion and how I look at my relapse anyway.', "Thanks for sharing this.  It reminds me alot of the olden days.  Although probably too young to remember, there was a time when we smoked EVERYWHERE, when secondhand smoke concerns weren't yet a concern.  Smoking was the norm inside everyone's house.  We smoked in bed, at work, in restaurants, concerts, football games, while pushing a cart and shopping in the grocery store.  I made 7 cold war submarine patrols and at least half the crew smoked.  About the only place smoking wasn't permitted was when pumping gas. \n\nThe more controls society imposed, the less smokers were able to smoke, the more nicotine deprived they became, with nicotine tolerance levels (cigs per day) ever so gradually declining, except for the self-employed or few jobs that allowed smoking.
