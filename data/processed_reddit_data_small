Immediately I stopped smoking actual cigarettes. Within 6 months I was chewing gum. Now 2 years later I haven't had a single cigarette since.\n\nFor me, nothing worked for over two decades until I started using e-cigarettes. This quite likely saved my life - just the new years before I finally switched I was having an enormous amount of health symptoms - shortness of breath, throbbing head aches, tingling and burning sensations in my extremities. I even passed out briefly at our new years party with a bout of light headedness. \n\nNow, it almost goes without saying, but since making the switch all of those symptoms have disappeared. Not only that but my health has made a huge rebound - I've lost weight since then and I've been able to go to the gym and work out, which was impossible before with my wheezing and gasping and massive blood pressure problems. \n\nIt's impossible for me to overstate this - I am so incredibly thankful that my wife convinced me to give e-cigarettes a try. I don't even want to imagine what would have happened to me if I hadn't made the switch and I heartily recommend it to anyone reading this thread and wishing that they could quit smoking but had failed multiple times like I did.

I paid $50 for mine. The Pico works well, but the tank is too small. Be prepared to fill it constantly.\n\nThe best advice I can give to a quitting smoker is to just skip all the things that look like a cigarette, especially Blu and the like, but also all the tube shaped vapes, and just go right to a box mod. Like the iStick Pico, or the Kangertech Subox Mini I started with. There are many options, all good, and the key for you will likely be price. I wasted money on Blu, wasted money on vapes that were cylindrical, and wasn\'t satisfied until I just got a real vape.\n\nI will not pretend that these are somehow better for *you*, though I think you\'ll be happier. It\'s just that they are so new, and I won\'t pretend there is science saying vapes are healthier. As of now, there isn\'t. In my opinion as a former cigarette smoker though, they are. At least a little bit.\n\nBUT\n\nThe immediate benefit you will get is that the vape solves nearly every problem non-smokers had with a cigarette. You will not leave butts behind. Your house will not stink, even if you vape like mad all day. You will not make the clothes of others stink. In fact the most common comment I get from non-smokers is something like, "what is that wonderful smell?" I once stayed in a hotel that did not allow smoking in rooms, but was okay with the vape, even though we asked them twice to be sure. Oh, no matter how you fall asleep with your vape, you will not and cannot burn down the house. \n\nI very much suggest you treat the vape as though it were a cigarette. I vape outside, do not vape into other\'s faces, and etc. If I can smoke here, I can vape here. If I could not smoke here, I do not vape. If you maintain normal smoker\'s etiquette with the vape, you will have no problems. Abuse of that etiquette by douchenozzles in flame shirts is how this lovely advancement got a bad rap. \n\nThis is the one thing I, a middle aged man, am angry at millennials about. Why could you, of all people, not be cool. Why. And stop making Youtube videos about it. Only the dorkiest of Cigar Aficionados made a hobby about tobacco. That was one of the things that made it cool. Nobody actually nerded out about it. You just smoked, all casual. It looked poetic between a lady\'s fingers, and was associated with suffrage. Edward Munch made a point to paint himself [holding one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iu2L7oA9QRg).\n\nDrawbacks. The vape is not cool. It just isn\'t. It doesn\'t LOOK cool. I once had somebody laugh at me for "sucking on the robot dick". Ain\'t nothing free. The main benefit of the cigarette is its slender profile, its poetry, it\'s association with fire. One can talk about breathing the air of hell. \n\nBut. Smoking is not cool. The kids don\'t smoke, these days. It\'s passe. Pretty girls (and lovely boys) didn\'t smoke much before, and now they really, really don\'t. The vape will not make your kiss taste like an ashtray. So even though the vape is a bit lame, well, smoking is even more lame. Those who are inclined to live and let live about vaping, despite its weird rep, will have real and understandable reasons to despise you if you continue to smoke. As I say, keep your smokers etiquette intact, and non-vapers will only comment on how lovely you make their world smell.\n\nIf not for some a-holes trying really hard to be fedora cunts and spoil it, the vape conjures the dream of smoking, rooms full of artful fog, but when the non-smoker walks into this fog, it smells like cherries, or butterscotch, not grimy tobacco. Frankly, you will not enjoy the flavors as much as they will, as scents. \n\nI cannot recommend the practice enough. Vape. Vape while you still can. \n\nAh. One last drawback. As a smoker, you were used to a cigarette being a cigarette forever, with few changes. But the vape is an electronic device made mostly in China. If somebody could recommend an American manufactured vape, please do, for some will care a lot about that. Like all electronics, vapes are constantly updated. New models and designs are forever being pushed out. The best of the designs stick around for a while, but you will be annoyed by your need to update. However, buy a popular model, and you will be satisfied for quite some time.\n\nAs per DONG_MAGNUM (ffs Reddit) posted, your days are sort of numbered here. They will soon regulate vapes into submission, and in a year, I don\'t know if my advice will be worthwhile. But for now, today, January 1st, there has never been a better time to buy a vape and ditch the smokes. I still fire up a cigarette here and there. I am never happy with it. You too can own this look of satisfaction.\n\nI cannot recommend vaping enough.

It hit /r/all and reminded me that I need to kick this shit for good.", "In my opinion its the only way to quit for a very high percentage of people. Compounding that, other methods can have pretty bad side effects. I was a BIG fucking tobacco user. I regularly used pipes, cigars, RYO, unfiltered, dip, chew, spliffs, dokha, hookah, snus, pouches. I was a tobacco enthusiast. 1+ packs a day. Lots of money. Lots of tar. I've been vaping since before it became a thing. When vapes actually got good and I actually for real stopped using tobacco it was life changing. Sometimes I miss a real cigarette but man if I smoke one now its usually pretty fucking gross. Nothing really beats a dip either when you are working in the shop or on the lawn. I don't even dare try to roll one of my fine fine RYO cigs, rizla papers, amsterdam shag, swan filters. But ecig is pretty god damn good and I've got a gallon of liquid that cost me almost nothing and my gums arent fucked up, I don't smell like shit, I can breathe, I can smell, I can ascend stairs, I don't have the threat of heart and lung disease looming all over me, my clothes don't smell like shit, my car doesn't smell like shit, no ashes, no butts, no rolling down the window in the car even, no going outside in the cold, no yellow walls in my apartment, no burns on my couch, no hole in my wallet. \n\nMy biggest advice is get a good liquid and a good vape from the start. I started out when vapes and liquids were both pretty shitty and then in the middle years when shit could get expensive and frustrating I vaped and smoked or dipped. Thats my second biggest advice, get your good vape AND DO NOT SMOKE. I have one friend that vaped and quit and two friends that do both. I seriously can't even stand a cigarette now especially when I got some big hit of chocolately yummy cool vapor right in my pocket. \n\nAs far as cessation I've only ever seen two people quit that I personally know. My dad did every fucking method; inhalers, gum for YEARS, patches, welbutrin, pouches for years (all have side effects worse than vaping AFAIK). After like 12 fucking years supposedly he quit. The other person I know got a shitty ecig and weened himself down by milligram and quit easy. Literally of all the people I personally know thats it. But then theres me, I love nicotine, I love the oral fixation, I love it with a beer, I love it in the car, and I got three batteries and a big fuckin dripper ready to bang bang. \n\nI started with those weird old clear things marketed on the internet that vaped who knows what. It faded out because it sucked then Blu came out. Tried that bullshit it was okay, or so I thought, kept smoking. Vaped on and off for a few years, mostly with a pen style and an old school 306 dripper. Then slightly more quality mods and more powerful tanks started coming out but they were still kinda frustrating and shitty and expensive. When affordable mods and sub-ohm tanks hit the market I entered the golden age. My first decent ecig when I finally quit was an internal battery 35w mod with a 1ohm coil in a tank. Cost me about $75, and it was kind of a piece of shit. Over the years 32mg, to 24mg, to 18mg, usually $13-$20 a bottle. I currently vape a 3 18650 battery mod that holds up to all kinds of abuse and pumps 200 fuckin watts and I got big fat nichrome juggernaut dual coils totalling .2ohms in a Doge and I'm assblastin 100%VG 3mg clouds that cost me THIRTY FIVE CENTS a bottle. \n\nIf you wanna quit go get a decent $20-$30 mod, sub ohm tank, and play around in the 8mg-14mg range until you don't crave. Wheen yourself off down to 0mg and work on getting rid of the fixation. Keep a bottle of 2mg around for emergencies. If you're like me, just start out with a nice $40-$60 mod - a nice tank - and a nice dripper - fuck the drama - play around in the 4mh-8mg range until you can get down to <3mg, and puff the fuck away. Either way your smell will improve, your breath will improve, if you smoke weed your ass gonna be coughin and takin huge hits and gettin hella high and the weed gonna taste hecka good, you gonna be goin up stairs like a motherfucker. \n\nP.S.

I know 3 weeks isn't long, but considering how easy this has been so far, I am so impressed with vaping and  I am absolutely THRILLED about my decision. I use the lowest level nicotine juices too!! Vaping a mod box has been incredibly enjoyable. I no longer smell like cigarettes, I no longer taste like cigarettes, and I am almost free from their grasp because of VAPING. I was a little hesitant at first because of the stereotypes, it seems that it's almost cool to hate on vapers these days. As a method of cigarette cessation, vaping is amazing, satisfying, and I have yet to try anything better. I do not miss my cigarettes one bit, and even in times of stress or during one of my usual cig ticks, vaping has completely satisfied ALL of my urges. \n\nThere are a plethora of flavors to satisfy your tastes, and a huge variety of products to try, making the discovery process absolutely amazing. Once you find what works for you, it's an absolute joy. I'm still learning, and i love this stuff. I will eventually stop vaping at some point as well, but compared to smoking cigarettes, this is an absolute JOY. Cigarettes had a huge impact on my wallet, health, confidence, and self esteem. That is slowly changing, thanks to vaping. :) ", "This sounds great, I'm a smoker living in the UK who's always wanted to try a vape so a competition win would be sweet!

Let's get this on /r/all for the 3rd time! Quitting smoking for your New Years resolution? We can help! Pop over to /r/electronic_cigarette and see how vaping has helped us!|*|["19 year smoker; vaping for 17 months now. Tried the disposables, worked for a couple of weeks, went back to the fags. Bought a crappy setup from the equivalent of a mall kiosk, it broke after a week. Back to the fags. Daughter was born. HAVE to quit smoking. Came to /r/ecr, listened in on /u/chris2vaped doing a QnA where people were asking the questions that I wanted to ask. Invested $60 in a decent setup and here I am now. I relapsed once - on day 11 I had to have a cigarette. 2 puffs later it tasted so vile I tossed it and haven't had any since. Vaping isn't a magic bullet, you do still need a little willpower for the first couple of weeks - your body's addicted to all the other crap that's in cigarettes beside the nicotine and it takes a little while for that to fade out - but since then it's been plain sailing. Dropped the nicotine level from 18mg to 1mg, and hopefully I'll quit vaping soon too. \n\nDon't be afraid to ask anyone here questions. There's no such thing as a silly one. If you think you do have a silly one and you don't want to put it in a thread, PM myself or /u/twin_sis or /u/hometownzero or anybody really. I have a 19 month old. I have to ask silly questions every day. Why is your teddy bear in the shower? Why is the dog covered in stickers? And you'll get a straighter answer from /r/electronic_cigarette than I ever get.", "I just wanted to say I think it's super sweet you quit for you daughter! \n\nI'm 20 now and have never smoked a cigarette in my life but my mom, aunt and grandma have all smoked 20+ years (my gramma smoking on and off for ~40 years) and I really hated it as a kid. I actually developed asthma from being around cigarette smoke so much growing up.\n\nAnyways, I decided for my 18th instead of asking for any presents or anything I would ask my family to stop smoking. I started crying and told them I just really wanted them to be in my life for a long time and smoking wasn't helping. It seemed to kick their butts into gear and they haven't smoked for 2 years! They instead picked up vaping and the 3 of them are all really into it :) It helped them a lot and I'm really happy they quit and are healthier! ", "Here from r/all and know basically nothing about vaping. Since you are open for questions: what set up did you invest in? Do different set ups have different pros and cons? For example, I have tried a few of those cheap gas station ecigs and my main problems were 1) I hated not being able to FEEL the hit in my throat. I don't know, I guess I've just grown accustomed to that feeling and it helps satisfy my urge. And 2) I had no idea when to stop smoking. With a normal cigarette I just go out, light up and then put it out when it's finished. I feel like with the ecigs I tried I just wanted to puff and puff and puff, there was no clear end. Sorry for the ramble. Any help is greatly appreciated.", "I'll help wherever I can! Mahalo for the mention, very kind of you. \n\nNow let us get some ex-smokers on a new path. \n\n\nAloha\n\n", "I'm from South-Africa - I have a vape store - even in this dark and weird corner of the world vaping is gaining ground. So if you feel that in our strange corner, vaping might be too new, or too 'out there', PM me, I promise I will help - not just with my vape store, but with the vast amount of suppliers in SA. All of them out there to help you get that monkey off your back :)", "I started vaping yesterday.  I really want to quit cigarettes completely.  Only problem I'm having really is the scratchiness on my throat after doing it and coughing a bit. It won't affect my singing voice?", "Just hours away from 1 year smoke free!\n\nThis community is awesome. Thanks peeps!\n\nEdit: T-minus one hour &amp; counting. \n\n100% sure I'll never turn back. The only thing challenging that assumption?\n\nRepressive, Big Tobacco, that won't accept that the consumer is fed up with their control &amp; disease. \n\nEdit Edit: It's New Year's morning & 1 year smoke free! Yeah! Used to be I'd wake up with a disgusting mix of smoke & alcohol flavored gunk in my mouth on a morning like this. The alcohol is still there but it's a big difference. ", "I smoked for 28 years, a little over a pack per day.  At 43, I found vaping and, in the last 16 months, I've had 1 cig.  Vaping is for ANYONE who wants to quit smoking.", 'Old guy here.  35 years i smoked a pack a day. 2 1/2 years off of the fuckers thanks to vaping.', 'Switched from smoking to vaping 4 years ago! My lungs seem happy about it :) \n\nI remember back in the day when e-Go came out and it was a game changer! Also when people figured out how to make carto-tanks by drilling tiny holes in their cartomizers... How times change! Now you can get a sick vape quicker than you can run down to the corner store and buying a pack of ciggys. Vaping really seems in its prime now and I love it!', "26 here, only smoked for 9 years (15-24) but was on 20 a day easily.\n\nSwitched to vaping, had 2 cigs in the last 2 years since I started (out on nights when battery died), and whilst I still enjoyed the cigs enough still, I much prefer vaping and would much rather not have another cig.\n\nI don't stink of stale smoke anymore, my mouth doesn't feel like ass half the day, I'm fitter and healthier than I've been in years, and whilst I know Vaping isn't GOOD for me, it's so so much better than smoking.  I've picked up running, going to the gym and everything again.", "I have been smoke free for 28 years. It's worth it.", 'Just turned 40, smoked for 20 years. It\'s been two years since I\'ve had a cigarette, all thanks to vaping. I don\'t go to vape shops and I don\'t preach about it, but I will say that it works. First couple weeks are pretty tough, and I still think about smoking from time to time, but if you do anything for that long, it\'s going to be a part of you for a very long time. \n\nQuitting smoking has never been easier. If you have a desire to quit, you CAN do it. This tastes better, smells better, and you will start to feel results QUICKLY. Those results will encourage you to keep going, and before you know it, you\'ve gone weeks without a cigarette. \n\nThere\'s a lot of quit smoking apps out there that can help you count the days, and counting days can be important when you\'re quitting. I didn\'t stop counting days until it had been well over a year. I opened that app several times a day for weeks. I checked how much money I hadn\'t spent on cigarettes, how many cigarettes I hadn\'t smoked, what health benefits I should expect, etc. I was still thinking about cigarettes, just as I had for the previous 20 years... i just wasn\'t smoking them. \n\nSome people say to throw out your pack of cigarettes when you have a set up for vaping. Personally, I did not. I kept my pack of cigarettes, because i knew the kind of anxiety that not having access to cigarettes caused me. I kept my last pack, and it was in plain sight in my bedroom. It was there if I absolutely needed it. Knowing that I could have a cigarette whenever I wanted actually helped me. When that craving hit me, I huffed on that goddamn vape like a fiend. But that craving would subside after 10 minutes of vaping hard, and I would completely forget about the cigarette. I tried one cigarette after a month of not having any - my cravings for them had subsided, I just wanted to see what I would think of them at that point. It was terrible, and I didn\'t finish it. I took a couple drags and put it out. It tasted bad, felt bad, and smelled bad. At that point, I knew I had won.\n\nWhen you first start, you might not know how long to vape in one go because it doesn\'t have the predestined time that a lit cigarette does. Don\'t be worried that you don\'t know when to stop. Just keep going until you feel like you\'ve had enough. Vape for an hour straight if you are having cravings. Just keep going until you\'ve had enough. You\'ll figure it out. \n\nSo I recommend finding a vaping solution that works for YOU... and at this point, it\'s not hard to find one! Don\'t worry about the people who say it looks stupid, say it\'s for douche bags, or whatever stigmas are attached at this point. You\'re doing something for your health, and you don\'t have to participate in any "vape culture".\n\nYou can quit, and it\'s never been easier than it is right now.', "Here's the bottom line for me.\n\nThree of my grandparents died of lung cancer. None of them ever smoked. I am genetically fucked. \n\nI also grew up on a damn tobacco farm. \n\nI smoked for 15 years. 3 packs a day at my worst. With my health failing in other areas, getting off cigs was absolutely imperative.\n\nI've been off cigs for 3 years. (well, 2 years and 51 weeks.) Outside of chronic conditions, my doc has given me a clean bill of health and her blessing to keep vaping.\n\nMaybe vaping is still bad for you. But I never started vaping because it was good for me. It's harm reduction, and for the present, that's the most important thing.", "I am quitting this year. Got a vape tonight from vape 101. This is what I got . Eleaf iJust 2 2600mah Sub-Ohm Starter Kit\nAstro by Space Jam - Bottle Size : 15ml, Nicotine level : 12mg\t\nUncle Junk's Jon Wayne - Bottle Size : 15ml, Nicotine level : 12mg\n\nI smoke about 1/3 a pack of light cigs a day . Any tips ?", "Giving that you have a sub-ohm setup, you might find that 12mg juice might have too strong of a throat hit, especially since you're a light smoker. If it's too much, switch to 6mg. Otherwise, that's a great kit you have and feel free to PM me or post up in /r/electronic_cigarette. Good luck!", "If you smoke 1/3 pack of lights per day, 12mg might end up feeling a little much. Especially with a sub ohm kit. You might want to look into 6 or even 3 mg. \n\nRemember, if that 12 is too harsh, you can always buy a 0mg of the same flavor to cut the nicotine in half so your money isn't wasted! Feel welcome to ask every question you have to the sub, we're mostly good folk. ", "Remember smoking isn't binary. You weren't formally a smoker, and now you're not, you're quitting smoking, it's a process and will likely take time. \n\nWhile it's important to set and meet goals, it's also important not stress out if it's not smooth. I've got a couple friends who go through cycles of trying cold turkey. They quit, then relapse once, and then it's over because they fucked up and get stuck in their head on it. If you have a smoke it's not the end of the world, what's important is that you keep going back to your vape. \n\nLong story longer, worry about not smoking the next cigarette, don't worry about being quit. ", "As everyone else has said, you may find 12mg very hard on your throat with a sub-ohm kit. Consider trying a 6, or even a 3mg, if you find the 12 a little too spicy.\n\nSecondly, you'll notice with a lot of eliquid, it will list a ratio of two items, PG and VG. It sounds as though you've done your research, but I'd still recomment looking for juice with a higher VG content, for a smoother experience.", 'Stay busy. I used to vape and smoke but once things got busy at the office, I barely had time to smoke. That helped get rid of the junk in cigarettes from my body. Since then, just the smell of a tobacco store makes me ill.', "Hi, this subreddit is pretty much where I quit smoking. It's been 3 years, 2 months and17 days (but who's counting?) since my last cigarette.  It's been over a year and a half since I last vaped. I never posted much, but r/electronic_cigarette is where I started researching and learned what to risk a few bucks on equipment-wise to start down the path to being smoke-free. I'm not sure I ever had a real exit plan on stopping vaping but I eventually weaned myself down to no nicotine juice and found myself, after a few months, forgetting to vape. The nicotine addiction had just kind of faded. Anyway, don't fear giving vaping a try - it's not for everyone, but it really changed my life after smoking some 25 years or so.", "I smoked for 22 years, around a pack a day, and quit several times.  It never lasted.\n\nI started vaping.  The first time I vaped using something other than a gas station cigalike, it stuck...  I have not had a craving.  I have not gained weight.  I have not been irritable or angry.  I have lowered my nicotine drastically with no cravings.\n\nI feel better.  I breathe better.  I smell better.  I am saving money.  My child told me yesterday how proud she was that I didn't smoke any more.  She's eight.  It's worth it, for the people around you, who love you.  Give it a try, for them.", "Nobody will see this, but 20 year pack a day former smoker here. Tried pills, sublingual liquids, patches, you name it. Nothing was able to get me to quit.  \n  \nBuilt an ecig out of a Smok Smooth and a Trident v3 and found Coval Vapes liquids.

They sell decent juice at really good prices. Before I started making my own this was the place I would go to buy the bulk of my juice. (I would recommend circus bear) As an added bonus they almost always throw in a free bottle or two, just because they are cool like that. 😎\n\n[Mt Baker Vapor](https://www.mtbakervapor.com/) \n\nThese guys sell fantastic juice at fantastic prices. They also sell flavorings which are very easy use if you are just staring DIY. I would personally recomend Moo Juice, its a very nice strawberry milk flavor.\n\n**To buy hardware:**\n\nIf you are juuuust starting out I would highly recommend an ego pen. They are what I started on and they both work and are extremely affordable. Right now [Vapes.com](https://www.vapes.com/shop/ego-ce4-vape-starter-kit-limited-time-offer/) is having a sale on a starter kit for $6. (Most places charge $20 or more for a pen, just to prey on the newcomers) \n\nFor a good starting device a step or two up from a pen I would recommend an [iStick 30w](https://www.misthub.com/product/eleaf-istick-30w-box-mod/). They currently are going for $26, but if you want to be able to use it you will need an atomizer. A good atomizer to start with is the [Aspire Atlantis 2](https://buyvaporizerpen.com/accessories/aspire-atlantis-2-sub-ohm?gclid=CjwKEAiAwZO0BRDvxs_1w-qFnhkSJABo10gge-z0mTnQAJkGTpWq6EaovqP5fRMtAp5GTEHC5nOvOxoCevHw_wcB). These are going for about 30 and are an extremely reliable, easy to use tank that holds around 3ml of juice. \n\nAnother fantastic starting device is the [Innokin Endura](http://www.myvaporstore.com/Innokin-Endura-T18-Starter-Kit-p/ink-end10.htm). This is a sleeker device that will only run you 30$ without having to buy a seperate atomizer. It features a 3ml tank and a 1000 mAh battery, which should last you a decent amount of time.\n\n**Choosing a nicotine strength:**\n\nMake sure to understand nicotine strength when ordering juice. (Keep in mind that in higher nicotine contents flavor will be harder to taste just due to the throat hit)\n\n0mg: No nicotine at all\n\n3mg: extremely light and almost unnoticeable in a pen, this works best with dripping atomizers or powerful tank setups.\n\n6mg: Pretty much the standard strength. Extremely light in a pen but not to strong in a dripper.\n\n12mg: Intermediate strength. Works decent in a pen and is bitey in dripper or tank. If you are quitting smoking I would recommend this if you are getting the iStick/atlantis setup I recommended earlier or something similar.\n\n18mg: Strong. Very bitey in a tank but can still be a decent choice depending on how long you have been smoking. This is pretty much the perfect strength in a pen.\n\n22+mg: Extremely strong. This is so strong to the point where it will mute the flavor of the juice due to its intense throat hit. Don't even bother running this in a tank or dripper unless you only plan on puffing. Mimics smoking really well in a pen though.\n\n30+mg: Anything this strong is either in a crappy gas station eCig or is nicotine base used in DIY eLiquid. Don't buy anything this strong unless you know what you are doing.\n\n**Understanding Vg/Pg ratios**\n\nMost juice is made with a vg/pg base.\n\nVg, or vegetable glycerin,  is a very viscous liquid that is metabolized into sugar. Due to its dense and viscous nature it creates a lot more vapor than pg. Pg, or propylene glycol, is a very runny substance that is found in many foods to preserve them and in asthma inhalers. It creates for more of a throat hit and carries flavor better. If you are running a pen I would recommend getting juice with a higher pg content than vg to taste the flavor a bit better, and if you are running a bigger device it would be better to get a higher vg content juice for less of a throat hit and more vapor production. \n\nIf these numbers are a bit confusing to you don't worry, most juice vendors have a way for you to select your nicotine strength and vg/pg ratio.\n\nTo recap, here is a helpful [infographic](http://imgur.com/a/THpUQ) that explains the parts of an e-cig and the ingredients to e-juice.\n\nWith all that being said I hope you have a wonderful mew year and vape on!\n", 'This is a good write up.\n\nHowever, I definitely think that the Atlantis is not that great of a starter tank by any means.  If you\'re a noobie, I would strongly, *strongly* recommend buying an [Innokin Endura](http://www.vapordna.com/Innokin-Endura-T18-Compact-Starter-Kit-p/endura.htm) as it has recently been released to rave reviews as the quintessential "made for smokers" starter kit.  \n\nIf you still want to go with the iStick 30w, I think that the [Nautilus Mini](http://www.vapordna.com/Aspire-Nautilus-Mini-Adjustable-Airflow-BVC-Tank-p/asb002.htm) is a great companion, however the tank alone is more expensive than the full Endura kit.\n\nIf anyone looking to quit smoking has any questions about gear or anything related, feel free to shoot me a PM.

I did my research and decided to go pick one up myself. I did use disposable ones for a while but eventually graduated to the same 30$ gas station starter kit. That was when I finally made the transition. I had the cheap one for a while then moved up to a better set up and now, a year later I haven\'t even touched a cigarette.

They were marginally cheaper than cigarettes, but made me feel worse physically.  \n\nWhen I considered trying vaping this past August, I was up to 5 or 6 Black and Milds a day.  I was looking for a way to cut back on my smoking.  It was in the back of my mind that I would ultimately quit, but I was mainly concerned with cutting back.  I picked up an Ego starter kit and some 12mg liquid... then had to go right back and but some 24mg liquid since 12 didn't quite do it.  Within about two or three days, I noticed I was reaching for the Ego over the cigars.  After about five days, I'd cut out cigars completely.  \n\nTwo weeks later, I broke my Ego while at work on a Sunday, where all the B&M's near me close early.  Knowing I would be able to go to one the following day, I picked up 3 cigars to get me through.  After using the Ego for two weeks, the cigars were absolutely disgusting.  I was only able to make it through about one and a half of them before I was able to hit a crappy B&M near where I work and pick up a replacement.  That was August 17, 2015, and that's when I knew I was done with tobacco for good.  And, I learned the importance of always having a backup device, tank, etc.\n\nTwo weeks after that, the Ego wasn't doing it for me anymore, so I got an iStick 50W and a Kanger Subtank Mini with some 12mg juice.  Like a lot of people, the more I experimented with lower resistances and higher wattage, my nicotine intake decreased pretty quickly.  After about a week, 12mg was too strong and I moved down to 6.  Three weeks after that, I started using 3 in my RDA.  About two or three weeks after that, I started buying only 3mg.  \n\nMy iStick has since shit the bed, but I've got a Sigelei 150W and a Kanger Subox Nano that I use at work.

The U.K. Has officially stated that vaping is 95% less harmful than cigs. Don't be misinformed by media that makes money on fear. ", 'vaping is just as bad. cold turkey it you weak fuckers or become worm food. your choice.', "Or just grow some will power and don't pick up another habit.  10 year smoker, decided to quit 5 years ago, tossed my pack, never looked back. \n\nYou're all a bunch of weak willed lazy people.", "I was a very mild smoker (started vaping at 6mg) only really smoking while drinking. One of my friends would come over with his ecig and always have delicious flavors. After a few times I was hooked on the flavors, the ability to smoke anywhere(inside, rain or shine, hot or cold out), and it satisfied my addiction to the action of smoking. \n\nSo I bought my own, just a little 20w istick. After a short while that wasn't enough, I wanted to make clouds like I'd seen my friend's mod create. So I bought a 50w istick and a sub ohm tank and used it more and more heavily over the next few months. I dropped my nicotine but hit it more and more, harder, deeper, and hotter; never really getting any satisfaction from it. By the time I was at zero nicotine I knew I was only hitting it for the clouds, the action, and the activity but hitting it became like chewing gum.\n\nAfter several months longer and an increasingly dry, weak, and constant asthma cough. I knew I had to stop before causing more damage than the cigarettes had ever had a chance to. So I did and three months later the cough is still here.\n\nVaping isn't healthy, don't let these studies fool you. Vaping is a fantastic tool to help quit cigarettes but only a distraction. I have always felt it is equally or more addictive than cigarettes due to the accessibility and taste. \n\nPutting anything in your lungs is unhealthy.\n\nEdit: The circle jerk in this sub is real. ", 'We get it.......you vape.....', "Public Health England says vaping is [95% less harmful than tobacco](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/e-cigarettes-around-95-less-harmful-than-tobacco-estimates-landmark-review)\n\nBut you're right, the ultimate goal should be to quit smoking everything. Happy new years mate", 'Vaping has shown to be far less harmful than cigs and not all vapers a douchey', "Show me an article claiming that ecigs cause cancer on circumstantial evidence, and I'll show you ten that prove that ecigs are a healthier alternative based on sound scientific research. ", "i think i'd rather die of lung cancer than vape and i don't even smoke", 'We get it, you vape.', ">You'll probably still get cancer \n\nDon't think so.\n\n> the crap which is in these things\n\nSuch as?\n\n* PG? Pretty unlikely. You inhale it every time you got to a show that utilizes fog machines. It's also in food and other products, for example chewing gum and toothpaste.\n* VG? Pretty unlikely. You inhale it every time you got to a show that utilizes fog machines. It's also in food and other products, for example chewing gum and toothpaste.\n* Nicotine? Not a carcinogen in its own right and about as harmful as caffeine on its own.\n* Flavourings? They're usually food-grade and should not pose a significant danger to your health, but you can always vape unflavoured juice if you're concerned.\n\nAnd that's it. That's everything there is to vaping. Nothing compared to the 12000+ different chemicals you get from combusting plant matter.", 'Meh, use /r/willpower instead of sucking on a chemical cocktail. Propylene glycol is still used in a lot of those and its potential health risks are still being debated on. And that is just one of many.\n\nE-cigs are a good "step" to quit smoking, but don\'t be content with it.']|*|['year smoker vaping month Tried disposable work couple week go back fag Bought crappy

You can do it, man.', "I was a pack-a-day smoker for 14 years until I started vaping on July 1, 2013.\n\nHaven't smoked a cigarette since and I never will again. ", "Good luck to you! I switched from cigs to vapes about two months ago and from the first hit I was hooked. It's a weird transition, I can now get a nicotine fix indoors I have all this extra disposable income I didn't know existed, and I'm vaping something called Unicorn Poop. What more could I ask for?", "Good for you! Don't push yourself too hard, if you still have a cig or two it's not the end of the world. Within a few days to a week you'll want your vape more than you want a smoke. And remember, this forum is a very very supportive community, you can always post just to share your experience and everyone will cheer you on.", "Don't get discouraged if it's tough at first. I went through a couple rigs before I decided on a vape that was satisfying enough to brake the devilish hold my Marlboro's had on me.

You'll find something you like and start saving your health and your money. ", "I used to love smoking. for many reasons. When I got my VV/VW device my pack a day habit dropped to a few real smokes here and there. Then I got my mech mod and haven't wanted a cigarette since. Don't start with a mech, they can be a bit overwhelming for a new vaper. Best of luck to you.", 'Good luck, dude! Pack a day for 20 years for me, and been smoke-free for two years thanks to e-cigs. You can do it!', "Just get the right equipment. I kept going back to smoking until I found a setup that allowed me to get the right amont of nicotine reliably.Head on over to the ecig subreddit and scope it out. \n\nAlso, it's a bit of a commitment early on but if you go 100% vape for 2-3 weeks you won't look back at cigs ever again. During the first couple of weeks you will try to convince yourself cigarettes are better.", "I'm approaching 2 years vaping. Find something you like and feel comfortable with, then stick with it. Drop your nic level over time if you want. I went from 18 to 3mg in about a year, then dropped to 0mg. When things get stressful I sometimes go back to 3mg, but it doesn't last long.\n\nDon't feel pressured or kick yourself if you falter. Pick yourself, try again, and feel free to ask folks here questions if you run into any problems with equipment. There's a lot of smart folks here.\n\nProud of you for giving it a go. Good luck.", "Been vaping for over a year, and just yesterday I built my first coil. The learning process was long, and without any knowledge of electricity, extremely overwhelming at times. I do suggest if somebody is serious about giving ecigs a go, it's best to start out with a little bit nicer equipment than your usual starter kit stuff. Something like a Tesla and a Kangertech protank will just solve a lot of frustrating issues you come across when you begin to vape (leaky tanks, short battery lives, etc.) My love is my Aspire Nautilus and my itaste MVP 2, because I don't have to mess with it. 5ml tank, nearly two days of battery life for me (I chain vape my itaste), not even a single drop of juice between the atty and the battery, absolutely no problems with it. The coils last a pretty good amount of time too.", 'eCig tech had advanced so much in the past year.  Now when a newbie asks me what to get?  eLeaf iStick, and a Nautilus Mini.

I couldn't quit until I found myself a good vaping setup that worked for me. I love it, even more than smoking. \n\n1) I FEEL so much better\n2) I don't smell like an ashtray all the time\n3) I now spend about $15 A MONTH on nicotine.

My mom has smoked 1-2 packs a day for 40+ years. I got her to try a starter kit that cost around $60-70 and the refills are like half the cost of smokes if not less. We were complete newbies, the local vape shop walked us through everything, had samples for her to try of different flavors and was able to add the appropriate nicotine level for her.\n\nShe was a die-hard smoker before. Pleas to quit fell on deaf ears. She was steadfast.\n\nOnce she tried e-cigs and finished the pack of tobacco she had open, she never had another one. She even tried to return the rest of her tobacco carton to the local gas station for a refund (not sure if that worked or not, she said she was a "good customer" so probably so). She had insisted on a menthol flavor juice and plenty of nicotine, within days she was eager to explore more options and ended up with a Tutti Fruitti-type flavor, when initially she said she didn\'t want "weird" flavors.\n\nShe was a hardcore smoker for 40+ years. She quit that basically cold turkey, saves a tons of money, sleeps better at night and has more energy during the day. I hate that shadow organizations advance a negative agenda on e-cigs. Even IF there may be some slight health risks, it is decidedly (to me and my mom) waaaaay better than the known risks of tobacco cigarettes. \n\nOne of many success stories. If you don\'t smoke, you can help a friend or family member get pointed in this direction.', "This is why we sound so crazy sometimes, almost evangelical, but this stuff actually works. I started over a year ago with no intention of quitting, it's cold in NY, so vaping inside my house seemed like a nice alternative. After 16 years of smoking, 3 weeks in and I was completely tobacco free and have been ever since. Now, I feel much better, lost over 20lbs and can run again. I can understand the speculation, quitting this way was way too easy. Once I was committed and could see a life without cigs was possible for me, there was no looking back. If you're thinking about it, give it a shot, each cig you don't have is a victory.", "Vaping works! 62 yo and smoked 46+ years. Tried it all over time, chantix, cold turkey, hypnosis, even a minor heart attack at 52 only quit for a couple of months! Started vaping in July and haven't smoked since.    \nHappy New Year and good luck on your endevours!    \nAsk here for help, tons of knowledge here on what works!", "I am a chronic pain patient and smoked 3+ packs of home rolled cigarettes a day for 29 years. That is very important to note because I didn't just smoke for nicotine. I NEEDED cigarettes because they helped to control my pain. Even still I accidentally quit smoking in June 2014 and the results have been so dramatic it is amazing. I never thought I could quit. EVER! I never even tried. I fiddled with e-cigs from the very first Chinese ciga-likes cicra 2007 on out until one day on a whim I went to a local shop and bought a decent midrange starter setup (think ego and aspire not evod) and within a month I was no longer a dual user. I was a vaper and an ex-smoker. I feel better but do have more pain but that was coming anyhow. You don't recover from Degenerative Disc Disease and that is just one tiny problem in the grocery list of things that cause me debilitating pain.\n\nMy Doctors are so on board with this switch they do not think I ever need to even lower my nicotine level.  All signs of my having ever smoked are disappearing and fast. My lungs were always clear and good with no shadowing but there is some visible healing showing on my latest chest x-rays. So I guess I did have some physical changes in my lungs after all. I have lowered my nicotine though. I went from 36MG in May to 18MG around October and my next round of huge purchasing will be in a few months I might drop down to 12MG at that point. \n\nI am extremely overweight due to Celiac, Allergies, Insane amounts of Steroids, Lyrica, bad genetics and emotional eating to dull the pain but I didn't gain any weight when I quit smoking. I actually lost weight because these amazing flavors help keep the part of my weight problem I can control in check. I no longer reach for things I am allergic too because I have such amazing flavors to vape like a Blueberry Custard with an awesome name like Jizmogoblin from Mt. Baker Vapor.\n \nThat is also important to note. Flavors keep me from overeating. I didn't get that metabolic slow down many people experience when they quit smoking. It was actually the reverse. So amazing.\n\nMy Blood Pressure was never bad enough for medication but would spike with severe pain. The last time someone smashed me in my car my BP was 180 in the ER. They were worried I was going to have a heart attack because they couldn't control my pain. I have since then been in comparable pain and my Blood Pressure never even topped out at 140. This might not be a huge change but my resting pulse dropped from 86 to 70 which is pretty amazing for a sedentary severely overweight person who can barely walk. I did nothing but switch to vaping. \n\nMy hair and nails started to grow like crazy when I quit smoking too. This is also amazing because I suffer from eczema over 80% of my body including my scalp. I was losing my hair last year and now it's growing despite that fact I bleach it to death every month to control the rash. My nails were so brittle from the lack of nutrients I absorb but do grow now that I quit smoking.\n\nOne final note is that I need surgery. My spine in my neck is beyond recovery. My cervical spine has straightened and is now bowing in the wrong direction. One disc has tri-compartmental stenosis which means the nerves are being compressed in 3 directions. I am the type of case that you hear about when someone just wakes up paralyzed. That risk is real for me. I need surgery. No doctor would touch me before because I smoked. The best case scenario is 20% fusion healing with a smoker. It goes up to almost 50% now that I quit. I need a tri-level fusion and that is a hugely complicated surgery with an obviously high failure rate. I do not have the Science to prove this only the various Surgeons who fired me because I smoked. They refused to do the surgery even though they told me I have no choice but to have it. I even had a Healer/Physical Therapist/Chiropractor refuse to take my case because he said he didn't think he should try to help me heal when I am undoing all of it by smoking. This man said this to me five years ago. It didn't even phase me other then crying my eyes out from the pain. I just kept on smoking. I was in real danger of death or a horrific quality of life but didn't even try to quit. Vaping has saved my life, very literally saved my life.\n\nIf anyone needs someone to talk to or recommendations on setups or even a freebie pack of juice, shoot me a PM. I have some flavors from Mt. Baker Vapor I'd be willing to ship for free to you if you need some help with juice and are over 18 in the USA. I do not know how many people I can help as I am on a very limited income being on SSDI but I will try. \n\nIf you take anything away from this long post take this:\n\nYou can quit smoking. You really can quit smoking and vaping can help you do it.\n\nHere's to a SMOKELESS 2015!!!!\n\nMuch Love and Healing to All,\n\nAnna\n", "The hair, skin, and nails thing has probably been the biggest difference for me.

It has a much better kick to it and it's a bit simpler. Less frustration just to get you started. I think they are 14 bucks? And rechargeable.\n\nThis is just to let you try it without completely wasting your money. It has a good vapor production. Being able to buy it is instant gratification - let's admit it, as smokers we are (I was) about that. \n\nIf you smoke less than a pack a day, the Blu may work for you just fine.\n\nIf you are okay with waiting, then I would suggest an eGo kit from an online retailer. You can price check these but I find that www.madvapes.com is very reasonable and fast with shipping.\n\nIt's a weird world out there with ohms and amps and nicotine levels and flavors and mods and ... there is so much to take in at once. It cn be intimidating and it's a thousand times easier to go to the store and just pick up a pack of Marlboros/Camels/etc...\n\nI suggest that you do not *try* to quit right away. Just give the ecig a try when you want a cigarette. Each time you reach for your smokes, take a moment and reach for the ecig, give it a few tokes/puffs. \n\nKeep trying to use the ecig more and more rather than just stopping smoking all together. \n\nIt takes a while to break the habit of reaching for a lighter, and it's different. \n\nAlso, when/if you do try vaping, it's a little different than a cigarette when you take that first toke/vape: Buttoned models: Hold the button down and bring the ecig to your mouth, do a long slow inhale. The atomizer needs time to heat up the liquid and vaporize it. \n\nIf you have a no button model: Do a few quick drags off of the ecig, then you can proceed with a long slow inhale. If it cuts off, don't worry. A lot of them have automatic cut off timers. Just wait a few seconds and do another long slow inhale :)\n\n/r/electronic_cigarette has helped many.

I have at this point tried just about everything to quit, and one of the guys I work with is getting in to this new "vaping" thing.  On his recommendation I went out and picked up what was literally the only affordable hardware at the time, a cigalike kit.  It worked for a little while, but it wasn\'t enough.  It was a pain in the ass to keep going (the battery life was crap, the cartomizers were crap  (they were hard to fill, hard to keep from leaking, hard to keep from scorching) and the overall experience was terrible.  I used them long enough to offset the cost of the kit in cigarettes saved, and then put them on the shelf.\n\nAnother skip-ahead to 2011, the wife and I are expecting kid #2, and our oldest is aware enough to know what daddy does when he goes outside and comes back stinky.  I found ECF, the electronic cigarette forum, and tell them my story.  They make recommendations based on the current hardware available, and I go out and buy more hardware.

I had done all of my research several times over, I knew what *didn\'t* work for me in terms of vaping, so I ordered some hardware with the intent that I\'d use it in the car to reduce the number of cigs I was smoking each day.  I picked up one variable voltage eGo and a protank (I wanted cinnamon juice, which does not-nice things to acrylic tanks).  It showed up on a Friday afternoon and I started using it that night.

It seems like they're using it to get around the ban, instead of trying to quit smoking. \n\nAnd so what if it's a convenient alternative to smoking? It's not nearly as bad for you. And only assholes vape in public. Most of us don't vape during movies or while shopping or at a restaurant. But the ban also applies to public parks and such, which is going too far. \n\nFurthermore, the government has no business to issue an outright ban like that. It should be up to the individual establishments to decide whether or not to allow vaping. ", "I saw that study and I say it's wrong. I haven't smoked even one cigarette since I got my e cig in March 2013. Go to /r/electronic_cigarette and see other people who have also quit.\n\nThe ban: I don't know all of the details, but I think they are banned wherever cigarettes are banned, right? I don't know their reasoning, but I can imagine people don't want vapor blown into the air in places like restaurants, stores, etc - and I honestly don't blame them. If I were eating in a restaurant or sitting in the movies, I woudn't want someone using an electronic cigarette in there either. But I still wish the business owner had the right to decide whether to allow it or not.", 'I am a very strong willed person, I would have had no problem quitting smoking with the help of gum. But not "ripping everyone a new one" whilst quitting, thats another story.  Now, I am 21 days analog free, not divorced and not jobless.  All thanks to this sub.  Thanks guys!', "One thing I can't quite understand is why people view vaping as so different from other nicotine replacement therapies. Many people use e-cigs the same way someone might use gum - they start off using a higher-nicotine juice, ramp down to zero, then stop vaping altogether. How is that different from gum/patches? For others that had no desire to stop smoking, it's a WAY less-harmful way of getting nicotine. I know people who have been chewing the gum for decades, but they don't get the flack vapers do. ", 'I quit after 10 years and many failed attempts by going to see a doctor and using Chantix. I recommend it to everyone that asks so long as you can deal with the side effects. \n\nI found too many "iffy" data points around e-cigs/vapeing nicotine. ', 'Thats what i did too.  It worked awesome and was so easy.  I tried the ecigs and felt i was wasting money still.', "Long time smoker here. I used to smoke a packet a day easy and you could double it if I had a beer in my hand. But realistically you are addicted to nicotine not just cigarettes. Doesn't e-cigarettes just change the delivery method? Sure it is healthier than smoking but what does nicotine actually do that is beneficial? If you smoke or vape pot it gets you high and has some health benefits, although some claims are dubious at best, so there seems to be a reason to do it. But nicotine does nothing other than perpetuate nicotine usage doesn't it? I went cold turkey. I ran. I hit the gym. I'm over two years now smoke free. It was hard but it taught me a lot about myself. I know for some a step like this may help. But ask yourself this:\nWhat is nicotine doing that directly benefits me?", "There's some studies that suggest nicotine has a positive effect on cognition and mood. I certainly feel it. It's not worth an addiction over to be sure.\n\nI've quit cold turkey before and had a whole year before relapsing. I've also quit with Zyban, and I've tried the gum (didn't last a week, shit tastes awful, experience was different).\n\nVaping is an alternative and if you're curious there's a large resource on reddit is all.", "This shouldn't be the recommended way to quit smoking. Its positives and negatives have not been researched enough. Head over to /r/stopsmoking and quit all smoking for good. I just passed year 2 of being smoke free and would not want to still inhale vapors. Quitting smoking means quitting not moving on to another method. \n\nEdit: i understand the ecig smokers will downvote, but this should be seen by people who want to quit legit. \n\n", "It's still buckets better than smoking. I'm down to almost no nicotine and I feel better, I have more energy and I haven't had the desire to smoke an analog in a month.\n\nCold-turkey never worked for me, I quit several times. Vaping worked for me. \n\nThere's a lot of misconceptions as to what is actually in e liquid. If you buy from a reputable vendor, you'll get a mixture of propalyene, glycol, vegetable glycerin, nicotine and FOOD GRADE non-oil flavorings... That's significantly better than the 50 or so ingredients in a cigarette including:\n\n\n* Acetone – found in nail polish remover\n\n* Acetic Acid –  an ingredient in hair dye\n\n* Ammonia – a common household cleaner\n\n* Arsenic – used in rat poison\n\n* Benzene – found in rubber cement\n\n* Butane – used in lighter fluid\n\n* Cadmium – active component in battery acid\n\n* Carbon Monoxide – released in car exhaust fumes\n\n* Formaldehyde – embalming fluid\n\n* Hexamine – found in barbecue lighter fluid\n\n* Lead – used in batteries\n\n* Naphthalene – an ingredient in moth balls\n\n* Methanol – a main component in rocket fuel\n\n* Tar – material for paving roads\n\n* Toluene - used to manufacture paint\n", 'How to quit smoking, according to /r/stopsmoking\n\nStep 1a) quit smoking\n\nStep 1b) be bitter because of withdrawals from nicotine and MAOIs. Dont forget that can pose a serious risk to your mental health especially if you have preexisting conditions. Oh well. \n\nStep 2) dont smoke anymore\n\nStep 3) be condescending to people who can quit with nicotine replacement therapy. ', "> Edit2: fuck u guys. Enjoy being a slave to a stupid vapor.\n\n/r/stopsmoking in a nutshell. Damn you guys don't like people that don't go cold turkey and feel better off not beeing assholes in the process of quiting.", "So the fact that millions of years of total time spent vaping has occurred and not a single problem has cropped up with vaping? What kind of negatives are you expecting there to be with inhaling the same aerosol that is used in pharmaceuticals and theatrical smoke machines? There is tons of evidence that nicotine is no more dangerous than caffeine.\n\nYou are beyond delusional if you think that harm reduction (most likely elimination) by switching to vaping is better than attempting to quit cold turkey. Even Chantix, the most effective official quit method, has less than 25% chance of success after a year. I think you're just mad that you had to go through withdrawal to get healthy again while we get to do it in 100% comfort and just as quickly.\n\nVaping is here to stay, and it will save hundreds of millions of lives in this century. Maybe that's what you don't want.", "Agreed. Im just under 2 years without a cig. Quitting wasnt easy but i'm happy that I didnt choose ecigs as it simply seems to be another, albeit less harmful, vice. Im happy for anyone that can quit smoking, ecigs or not. But if you can do it without ecigs more power too you. ", "reminds me of Uncle Buck's [stop smoking plan](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDnfNzmV0FM)", "Woah woah hold on there. You're making some SERIOUS conclusion jumps there. I only buy hand crafted ejuice with food grade vegetable glycerin and natural flavoring.", "i used to smoke 5 cartons a day, now thanks to electronic cigarettes, i don't smoke 5 cartons a day. thanks electronic cigarettes.", 'Harm reduction, sure, as methadone is harm reduction for some illegal drug addiction.  In the end, however, the intake of nicotine is the real problem.  \n  \nMy issue with this vape culture movement is that people tend to believe they are \'safe\' now that they\'re not lighting up.  Secondly, it\'s an incredible buzz marketing industry that relies more on psudo-science testimonial marketing jargon than any real evidence to support the safety claims.  Raises all kinds of red flags, push push push to get people addicted to the new tobacco product then pretend not to know it was "bad for you".  This is exactly the bullshit that got the tobacco industry in countless lawsuits to begin with.  To believe that the tobacco industry is not 100% behind this to begin with is fool hearty, this is the new product category they\'re all struggling to get into to get a new segment of the population addicted to their products.\n\nIs it safer than smoking, probably, is it safer than not smoking or vaping at all, absolutely not.\n  \nUse this as a crutch to get clear of the tobacco products entirely, but who\'s going to get you clear from the vaping when you believe it\'s safe?  \n\nCaution at best.', 'You\'re being downvoted, and although I won\'t do it myself, I\'d like to explain why.  \n\nFirst, as you\'ll see everywhere in this thread, nicotine by itself is about as harmful as caffeine.\n\nThe marketing that you\'re seeing comes from the big guys.  Very few of us on this sub use anything made by them, and many of us disapprove of their bullshit.  "I can use it at a basketball game!" Well, you can, if you\'re an inconsiderate dick.  \n\nThe tobacco industry tried to get the FDA to shut down vaping.  We resisted.  One of the big guys (blu, who were independent at the time) took the FDA to court to stop the seizing of shipments from China of vape gear and won.  We don\'t like them any more than you do - those guys took our money for years, sometimes decades, for a product that would eventually kill half of us.  In this sub, in general, we don\'t trust them, we don\'t like them, and we don\'t use their subpar vaping products.  \n\nIs it safer than inhaling nothing but clean Montana air?  Of course it\'s not.  But I switched from cigs to ecigs and now I can wander down to the gym and go 5K on the treadmill without wheezing after the first 100M.  I\'m just speaking for me, but that\'s a helluva lot better than where I was a year ago.  \n\nAs for using it as a crutch, that\'s *exactly what many vapers do*.  I started out at 24mg of nicotine per ml of liquid.  That lasted a month.  I dropped down to 18mg/ml, and that lasted ~7 months.  I\'m at 12mg/ml now, and it\'s working out.  When I feel that\'s too heavy, I\'ll drop to 6.  Maybe to 0.  And after that?  Maybe I\'ll quit vaping altogether - plenty of others have.\n\nRemember those nicotine patch "step down" ads?  That\'s exactly it, but with something that simulates the smoking experience and tastes delicious.  And from the anecdotal evidence here as well as the research that\'s being done, it\'s working far better than anything that\'s been sold before.  \n\nWe\'re not here to tell you to vape.  We\'re here to tell you that if you\'d like to quit smoking using e-cigs, we\'ll try to set you up for the best chance at success.', "Any current smokers or former smokers, could you please take 2 minutes and take this survey.

I'm getting ready to dial it back more and more until it's virtually non existant. Already I don't have anywhere near as strong of cravings as when I smoked cigs. If my battery dies, it's more of an oh well now rather than an oh shit when I used to run out of cigs.

Cigarette Tax (Satire)|*|["And that's where Canada fucked up. I got tired of paying $100/week for a carton so now I use an ecig that costs maybe $30/month.", "You got it! It also varies by area. Arkansas is a poor state so cigarettes are $4-$6 a pack where a place like NY that has more money they're double/triple the price. Big Tobacco likes to find the perfect balance for each state to maximize profits. ", "I'm 18 and everyone I know with any income at all smokes. govermet pls halp", "Pack of cigarettes in Chicago = $12.50. Each cigarettes averages out at about 62 cents. I smoke a pack a day - comes out to about $375 a month. I'm a fucking moron ", 'In Australia cigarettes are around 25$ a pack.  I think in New York they are around the same prices.  Cigarette taxes are crazy in some places.  \n', "Realistically, what's to stop me from buying cigarettes in bulk where I live (as low as $35 a carton) and selling them on the street in NYC or Chicago for a tidy profit?", 'As a non-smoker that happened to see this on /r/all, I just wanted to say I read an [interesting article](http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/expensive-cigarettes-no-longer-keep-teenagers-from-smoking/) this past weekend that discussed the diminished rate of return on taxing cigarettes. Essentially they\'re showing that the remaining smokers will keep smoking no matter how high the price is. It\'s interesting that the government still "wants" you to quit, but if they\'re getting enough revenue from those few folks that refuse to stop, then they might as well keep raising the tax. It\'s a "win-win" if they can discourage smoking *or* raise revenue for certain programs. I\'d watch out for vape taxes in the future, seeing how marijuana taxes in Colorado have been so wildly successful.', 'Cigarette tax increases are always lauded by lawmakers as a way to discourage smoking *and* raise "X"-million dollars in state revenue.  \n  \nBut when you look into the numbers for how their "X" is calculated, it always assumes the exact same cigarette sales as before the new tax is passed.  \n  \nYou don\'t need to debate their sincerity. Their own income projections assume nobody will stop smoking.', "But it's not the governments place to tell us to stop smoking, if someone wants to be a pack a day smoker and day when they're 30 they should be able to. If someone wants to save their life and switch a much safer alternative, they should be able to, even if our dumb government stops getting money from us.   \n\n\nEDIT: As many people have pointed out, yes they say the tax is for health costs and etc. but I think as Truth About Vaping has showed us, that really isn't their only motive.", "Hey I didn't know this sub existed, this is the first time I've seen it on /r/all.  I've got a Kanger EVOD 2 from DashVapes and couldn't be happier with it.  I was a little worried when I got into vaping because I saw all these people just buying more and more expensive and elaborate vaping machines, and I was worried I wouldn't be satisfied with my little $50 pen.  But it's been perfect for me, and has helped me quit the baccy!", "There's also /r/Canadaelectroniccigarette :)", "I got this little Itaste VV for $40 or $45 over 6 months ago and I've been happy as hell with it. My local vape place had their own liquid for a while that was $5 for 30ml and with these two things combined vaping has been very cheap for me! They stopped making the house stuff a couple months ago and when I went in last week to get the last of one of their flavors they surprised me with a bunch of juice for free. I smoke a higher mg still and these are 24mg. They stopped selling above 21mg so they had all of this left and knew I'm always trying to save money so they gave it to me free of cost.\n\nhttp://imgur.com/pvlzA2K\n\nI couldnt believe it when he handed me the bag full of juices when I only asked for two. Vaping has turned into a much cheaper alternative than cigs for me :)", 'Excellent in describing the vaping situation, going to share with friends/family.', 'Kinda like Arkansas pretty much banning vaping.', "Can you order concentrated nicotine juice?\n\nIt's super easy to make your own juice if that's the issue. As long as you can make your own coils, you should still be able to get a hold of VG and flavoring.\n\nThis is something that's easy to make on your own if you needed, and the parts by themselves will never be banned (except possibly nicotine juice). There's no way. Assuming you have a mod and can make your own coils, the juice is the easiest part. If you don't vape nicotine, you're good for sure.\n\nIt's seriously easy. I fill a bottle a quarter of the way with my 24 mg/ml nicotine VG liquid, fill the rest up with VG, then top it off with flavoring, which usually should be about 10% of the final product.\n\nIn 10 minutes I made 60 ml of my favorite juice that I vape daily (lavender, ~6mg/ml nicotine, 100% VG).\n\n/r/DIY_eJuice for anyone considering. After I started doing it, I felt so silly how much I spent on pre-made juice. It's ridiculous how easy it is to do, and even if you have a favorite juice, plenty of people out there try to make recipes to clone it.\n", 'They didn\'t "ban vaping." They simply limited the sale of all vaping products to in-person sales at brick and mortar stores in Arkansas.\n\nIt\'s definitely horrible, but it\'s not a ban.', "In my county the cigarette tax goes to funding the arts programs and provides a bunch of funding for artists as well as subsidizing museums, theaters, fairs, and other stuff (basically, a lot of the cultural stuff is free or very cheap in my area because of it).\n\nNow the tax was instituted with the goal of lowering smoking rates and smoking rates are dropping, but funding hasn't been cut. This is because, since the beginning of the tax, they've earmarked a certain amount of the tax's revenue into a ln investment account. So even as the tax income is decreasing, the amount of money they get yearly is slowly increasing. ", 'I am glad to hear you have quit smoking.  That is a big improvement.  \n\n2 years vaping.

We can't fall to their level. If the anti-vape campaigns ignore facts to support their claims, we as  pro-vapers can't be evangelists that put our hands over our ears and deny facts and claim money conspiracies every time they aren't exactly what we want.

Extrapolating from the results at high voltage, an e-cigarette user vaping at a rate of 3 ml per day would inhale 14.4±3.3 mg of formaldehyde per day in formaldehyde-releasing agents.\n\nSo what I am reading here is that generally you would have to Vape at 5.0 V to get the allotted dose as described in the article.\n\nMy battery is 3.7v, I think I am okay with my mod.\n\nNote: I never graduated college, but it reads pretty well\n\n[Source study](http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc1413069)", "You're half right.

However there will be voltage drop with your mod, and the atomizer, not reaching the limit of 5v. I really don't find the voltage relevant, it would have been more credible to use temp of the coil. I could wrap 32 gauge 50 times or more for a coil, and have a 4 ohm resistance coil, and throw 10v at it and likely have far less vapor production.\n\n I was more confused by the paragraph before. consuming 5-11ml of eliquid every 5 min.

At a voltage of **5.0V**, the wattage would be **14.7W**.

However, such conditions are not realistic, as they could not be tolerated by an actual vaper. Therefore, extrapolating from this study to a lifetime of vaping is meaningless.\n\nBasically, at normal operating wattages, no formaldehyde was created. But, when pushed well beyond it\'s limits, the tank/atomizer creates a phenomenon known as a "dry hit". The atomizer burns faster than the juice is wicked, and this burns the insulator, the wick, and possibly even slightly melts the resistance wire. Some of which will release harmful chemicals. However, a human vaping under these conditions would notice this immediately and probably start hacking their lungs out. They would then dial it down to normal, and safe wattages.\n\n>Using the high voltage for as long as the researchers mimicked in the study "creates a burning, acrid taste" called a "dry puff" that would cause users to adjust the e-cigarette, [Gregory] Conley said.\n\n>What the researchers did is like leaving a steak on a grill all day — many cancer-causing substances might be formed but no one would eat such charred meat, he said."

The puffs were only 3-4 seconds. Low-wattage setups should be good, though.\n\nThe study seems rigorous. Please stay critical and avoid defending something just because you like it.', "The study you reference used an atomizer that burns at 7-8 watts and fired it for 4-5 second puffs at 12 watts.  Since their machine can't taste that it's burnt and will keep drawing for 4-5 seconds, their results don't have any relation to real world usage, where one would  fire it for less than a second somewhere closer to 8.5 watts and then turn it back down because it tastes burnt.\n\nThe study is not rigorous.  It's bad science because the experiment was poorly designed and has no correlation with actual real-life usage.  This is not at all how people use these things.\n\nIf someone wants to study vaping and get good data, they need to know enough about how they work to choose appropriate equipment and use appropriate power settings for the equipment they're testing.  The fact that everything has a 510 connector doesn't mean that everything can work together at the full range of power levels.

I only talked to him for a little while after the hearing, but he seems like a very genuine, humble guy. He owns 906 Vapors in Houghton Michigan.', "My mom has been desperately trying to quit smoking. I gave her the idea to vape because it was what got me off of it. Every time I convince her to try it, she hears and reads articles about this and this vaping ban, drove her to a firm no. My mother will die of lung cancer if she doesn't quit. Just like her mom and her dad before her.\n\nI will be showing this video to her and hopefully it will move her. If you want to quit smoking vaping works. If the ban actually happens, screw the govt, learn how to make your own juice and do not settle for this corruption. DIY juice is ridiculously easy and safer imo, there is no reason why anybody couldn't do it. Do it for your loved ones, and do it for yourself.", 'As an American I’ve just been completely mind blown by the stupidity of this government over the past couple of years. It’s Big Tobaccos turn to seek its favor from our president. And this is Trumps doing and only Trumps doing. Big Tobacco will have its way and this amazing community of small independent Vape manufacturers will fail. Within a year the 5 or 6 kings of corporate smoking will unveil their own line of Vape products approved by the government. I’m so happy to live in the greatest country ever to exist on planet earth', 'What is crazy to me is the marriage between big tobacco and the anti smoking people.

But the cigarette industry is losing money, so this is who driving the law.', 'Vape shop owners who act like they’re in the business of saving lives are such pretentious douchebags. You aren’t in the business of saving lives. You’re in the business of selling cheap Chinese garbage to people who are too stupid to order it online for 1/3 of the price. Gonna get flak for this comment but it’s the truth', "I can totally see why you're so jaded towards vape shops, and honestly I can't blame you.\n\nI had a shop for nearly four years before selling it, and I opened the damn thing to help people, but also because got really tired of the expensive ass prices from other shops.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I live off the shop's income, but I wasn't driving a vinyl wrapped lambo or anything.\n\nI'd markup maybe 10-15% tops on everything.  I was one of the first shops to have $15 100mls of any brand.  If I got a coil wholesale for 2 bucks, I sold em for $3.\n\nMy rent was $2,600\nMy electric was $400-$500\nMy liability insurance was $1k/month\nMy payroll high as I paid 13-15 an hour to watch netflix\nMy cable/internet was $270\nMy Cintas was $280\n\nNot to mention a ton of other costs..\n\nSo yes, shops need to make money to stay open.  That being said, some shops rip people off.\n\nI had an open return policy, and took care of my customers, even though my suppliers rarely accepted returns.\n\nSo pricing aside, you do have to realize that 80%+ of people who smoke or vape do not use social media or online sources for vaping.  They have no damn idea on how to even get started.\n\nShops are why the industry has been introduced to millions of ex smokers.\n\n\nSo before you just swear off all shops, realize they introduce people to harm reduction at rates no online store can ever do.", 'This is actually one my friends, the vape shop he ownels helped me stop smoking marb-reds in college and he along with his friend/employee has helped me find a way to accommodate my dad and he is now almost a year cigarette free after smoking for about 40+ years.\n\nThey have helped many people in the community stop smoking cigarettes as well as the store has never sold to minors, I had my ID checked 6 years ago and every time someone bought in that store they had theirs checked too. Responsible shop owners are being punished as well as people who need the help.\n\nIf you guys want to show him some love I will be sending him this post, and I encourage you to reach out to these wonderful people. I have seen some fantastic comments and want him to know people are on his side. He has a Facebook page for his business and is still fighting for our right on there as he has for years.

Forbes: ". . .vaping, at least so far as we know, is the most successful smoking cessation product any one has as yet invented. . ." -- Support those who support Vaping!|*|["It is. I can see big pharma's side too though -  it does indeed cost wast amounts of money to get a new product to market.  \nAnd when you easily spend 10~15 years with R&D,  clinical trials & jumping through legal hoops...you have to recover your massive investment fairly fast, since the patent is only good for 25 years...\n\nSo we end up with a market full of vaguely effective ways of quiting, each costing the same if not more than buying cigarettes. \n\nBut e-cig have been out for a while now...if you're in the tobacco or smoking cessation business - your next big thing damn well better be a vaporizer.  \nHeck I'd pay more for nicotine free liquid with some medicin or whatever that gave it just the right throat hit.  Or a setup that tasted just like the cigarettes I used to smoke  (okay a bit less like ashtray preferably).\n\nThe generation still in charge cling to what they made their money on...tobacco, oil, guns & medicin.  \nMedicinal marijuana is bad because you can't patent it, except if you trash the cannabinods & make a pill of it...electric cars are bad cause you own a refinery or a ton of shares in the business...guns? Well we gotta have more guns, always - never fewer, only more...and e-cig? Well they missed the wagon, but could easily get on board - if they could just get their head out of their asses, cut their loses on whatever mildly effective cessetation they have been working on.\n\nI mean..andre they really that stubborn/stupid (or keeping their triumph well hidden), they could make medicated juice and whatnot!  \nSore throat, oh just vape 2 ml of this...and ready made setups/oil-juices for weed in the legalized states", "Hey guys. \n\nCaught you on r/all, I unsubscribed long ago... Not because of any negative reason but because I quit nicotine entirely.  \n\nA couple years ago I decided to give vaping a shot. With help from this sub I got a Vivi Nova. Remember those?\n\nBought juice from Vape Dudes and My Baker Vapor. \n\nAnyways over years I slowly would drop down in juice. I stuck withy he same batteries but now was on the EVOD? I think. Anyway, I was now on what I called 2mg but it was some other ratio in sure but barely any. It was so low I had to mix it with zero because Avail didn't sell them that low. Turns out I was accidentally using full zero nicotine for a few weeks and didn't even notice so I just....stopped back in August. \n\n\nLast week I gave all my vape stuff to a friend and her husband. I also went with them to the vape shop to get them into it. They have since both converted completely over to vaping. \n\nI no longer need to but will continue to support and fight to keep vaping accessible to the public to quit. It actually works. \n\nI want to personally thank this sub for starting me on the path to cessation. Thank you. ", 'My comment on Forbes:\n\nI started smoking when I was 14 yrs. old as a Freshman in High School. Everyone in my household smoked; Father, Mother, 2 Grandparents, so it was “normal” behaviour. And when I went to High School, it was ‘cool’ to smoke. I ended up being a pack-a-day smoker.\n\nAfter 44 years (and after trying numerous times to quit smoking; cold turkey, Patches, & Gum) I found E-Cigarettes! After using an E-Cig or PV (Personal Vaporizer) for 1 month, I quit burning tobacco in all forms (Cigarettes, Cigars, & Pipes) on 8/8/2009. I’ve been tobacco free for over 5 years. Personally, I have much better health and greatly improved sense of smell and taste. I have also transitioned from using 32 mg. of nicotine to 2 mg. of nicotine over these 5 years.\n\nI can attest that no one would voluntarily transition from vaping to using a real cigarette as they taste and smell horribly bad!\n\nAs to the science surrounding the benefits of using an e-cig and the lack of second-hand effects to others, there are currently over 50 scientific studies conducted in the last few years showing the benefits of e-cigs & lack of harmful bi-products.', 'Congrats, I have been vaping since 2008 and I never get tired of hearing success stories. I totally agree with Jimbo52. I have only met a few vapers--in 6 years--who still like the taste of burning tobacco. ', "Wow, this is almost my exact story also, just not quite as long.  Pack a day smoker for 25 years, have been completely smoke free for 15 months now. \n\nCongrats on five years dude!\n\nOne thing I would like to add, and it's the reason I intend to keep vaping, is relapsing after quits.  \n\nI'm not sure if you went though this, but during my 25 years of smoking, I successfully quit 3 times (and failed countless times).  Once for 4 months, once for 6 months, and the longest was for 18 months.\n\nEven when I was long over the nicotine addiction, if I would walk past a smoker outside a bar, or just on the street, I would take a deep inhale (passively).  Something in my brain would always long for the sensation of smoking, or maybe just deep down, I just enjoy the sensation. \n\nSo all it would take would be a few to many drinks, a bit of stress, or some other loss of willpower, and I would be back to smoking death sticks. \n\nSo when I discovered vaping, I saw something that wouldn't just get me tobacco free, but keep me free, and give me the pleasurable sensation that I enjoy. \n\nOh, and if I walk past a smoker now, I think it smells like shit. \n\nOne thing I like to tell people, smoking was a habit, vaping is a hobby :)", 'Sounds about right.\n\nI smoked a pack a day and then quit for a few years, but during the time I had "quit", I loved the smell and taste of cigarettes, and I still bummed one here and there.\n\nI was about to break down and buy a pack, but I got an vaporizer instead.... For a while, I still liked the smell and taste of cigarettes and wanted one when friends smoked, but then something happened. I just started hating the smell and taste of cigarettes. Now, I don\'t even have to try to not want one.', 'I always assumed my dad would smoke until it killed him. Started in his teens. By twenty was smoking a pack+ a day.  When I was growing up he tried fucking everything.  Medicine that made his hands swell from allergic reaction, every gum or patch marketed, and even acupuncture.  \n\nTwo years ago after at least 20 attempts to quit he and his wife tried E-cigs. They were smoke free within 2 months. He now uses pretty much nicotine free stuff. E-cigs bought him hopefully a few extra years of life. ', 'It\'s been almost 2 months since I quit analogues and I can say I am absolutely happy to be vaping.\n\nWhen I started smoking at 17 I thought it was cool to smoke, but as the years went by (21 to be exact), it became more and more something I was ashamed of. Now with 2 young boys I have been trying to quit for a while and have always made it a point not to smoke in front of them.\n\n2 months down and I have on 1 occasion tried an analogue and can say I hated the smell. On another occasion I really wanted to try again what it was like to go analogue but found it much easier to just turn away. I\'m now happy to be able to get my fix while sitting at my desk working and in the house while watching TV.\n\nIt\'s sad to see governments playing the "We don\'t know how dangerous it is" game, when it\'s absolutely clear that vaping is "the best" smoking cessation that real ex-smokers have come across. Yes, it\'s all about the money they\'re losing from taxes, and now I\'m sitting here laughing at them because they\'re not getting my money any more! I say go find somewhere else to make money to fill your greasy pockets.', "Been 90 Days today for me from being a pack-a-day smoker, and it's thanks to vaping.", '"That\'s only anecdotal evidence" be damned.  I\'m at 18 months since I started vaping and haven\'t looked back.  Nothing else worked for me, until the day I decided to check out the e-cig counter at my local smoke shop.\n\nStarting smoking is the worst decision I ever made.  Starting vaping is one of the best decisions.  Started at 18mg juice and I\'m down to 6mg juice and using barely a tank a day.', "I started smoking when I was 16.  I kept smoking cigarettes, at about 1/2 a pack a day, until I was 33.  To smoke at my parents' house, I got a freebie e-cig from an online giveaway.  The day I tried the peppermint e-cig, I knew I found a way to get rid of regular tobacco for good.  I didn't even want to finish my last pack.  E-cigs freed me from the embarassment of buying cigarettes (it made me feel like shit to go and buy them, knowing that they'd kill me) AND made me smell better (with my nose and no more stinky clothing).  ", 'I traded my old truck in a few months back and found my last pack of cigarettes in the glove box from five years ago. \n\nI literally put them in there and forgot them the same day I got my first Gamucci 808 in the mail. ', "This is what I don't understand with all of these news agencies saying it could be a gateway to smoking real cigs...I can't think of any reason why I would ever smoke a real cig again. They taste disgusting after I've been vaping for a while now.", 'This is what I was coming to say. \n\n>Others say that people are using them not to quit but to keep smoking, and that they could become a gateway for young people to take up real cigarettes.\n\nI can\'t see it happening. Why get into vaping, with all the cool gadgets and flavours, and then think to yourself, "gee, I\'d really like to get into something more smelly, messy, less tasty and be totally shunned by society"?', "That's a pretty good article, thanks for posting it! I wish more of the people against vaping could see it in this light. That vaping actually isn't the devil and that it's actually helping so many people quit smoking, literally saving their lives. I smoked for almost 10 years. Since I was 16 to 25, pack a day. I owe my life to the people that made vaping available and cheap enough for everyone. But Big Pharma and Big Tobacco just think they can cash in and screw over vapers... It's really sad that our government that's supposed to be protecting us and helping us is actually our worst enemy, not just in vaping, but all across the board.", 'Now I feel bad for picking up vaping, and having never tried a cigarette (and never will).', 'So I posted this on another article, but wanted to also post the question here:\nI smoked for 15 years and then 6 years ago found vaping and never looked back. I never tried NRTs, but I am curious how the Reddit community experiences vary from this and similar reports.\n\nShare your story regarding your experiences with NRTs vs Vaping. \nHow long did you smoke? \nWhat NRTs have you tried? \nWhat was the overall experience?', "I smoked for 29 years, the last 10 years of which, I smoked nearly three packs per day.  I tried cold turkey, patches, pills, gum, hypnosis, inhaler, and every other quit smoking gimmick ever created because I really wanted to quit - I knew it was horrible for my health.  I bought my first Spinner and some juice almost 8 months ago and haven't looked back since.  I quit smoking the cigarettes overnight.  Three packs a day to zero with not so much as a wimper.  I've dropped the nic level in my juice, now, to 3 mcg and sometimes 0.  I feel so much better that it can't be put into words.  Vaping saved my life!\n\nMy concern is, tobacco taxes have always been about the revenue.  The gov't doesn't give a rats ass about public health - they want the money.  As more people quit and tax revenue drops, what are we going to be facing?  They will drum up something to attempt to justify taxing juice - all in the name of public health (wink, wink) and a lot of sheep will willingly go along.  That concerns me.", 'I want to like the article but he doesn\'t make the point that these devices are actually used for cessation. There is no evidence that these teenagers and pre teens were addicted to cigarettes and nicotine before picking up a vape. So this is just going to be more fuel for the fire of the "baptists" as he refers to them. "These devices are causing kids who would never smoke to start a nicotine habit".

At the very least, they can sue the people you're claiming to have given you any information.   \n\nYour clean room statements aren't even close to be true.  Now you're talking out of your ass!  If you're going to make something up at least have some basic knowledge of it first.  Why would an ejuice company have more steps for a clean room than hospitals who are actually opening people up and are filled with more germs than your toilet??  \n\nAnyways, you have made yourself look like an angry little troll to the intelligent portion of the vape community and as for the ones who aren't intelligent enough to see through your BS, they're entertainment for me!

A lot has to do with being cigarette smokers for so long, and then I think over time you appreciate subtlety more.\n\nI would look into independent lab tests (those not sent in by Pip) and decide for yourself.

Now in that same analysis there was 2.75ppm Di-acetyl in the mix. Is this independent analysis giving us the real picture and if so does that mean that it is unsafe to vape this liquid?

Coworkers and friends agree.  I also pay maybe 1/10th the price of what I was paying when I first started vaping.  If you vape do yourself a huge favor and head over to /r/diy_ejuice.

One that needs to always be made in these discussions right now. Legal nicotine vaping products are not killing anyone.', "How's it killing big tobacco when BIG TOBACCO OWNS (Many), and owns tremendous amount of shares on MORE THAN ONE e-cigarette companies... A huge stake.", "Not as big as cigarettes markets, and they don't own all the brands, right now, it seems like the plan is to kill vaping as it is (all organic competition, open systems, ejuice makers), help law changes so only they can survive and the price to enter the field would be steep, next a new campaign to clean the dirt of vaping will be launch so that your grandma will be bugging you with Facebook articles about how new vaping is so much better than not smoking at all (err) and all you'll have as choice is eMarlboro with antioxidants or eCamels with calming effects.", 'And who is responsible for starting the majority of controversies around vaping ? Oh that right. It was juul. Also altria is only a major stake holder. They don\'t own the company but they have a huge vote in what happens with it. Also the CEO of the company is an exec from Marlboro. I hate when people say that big tobacco has no interest in killing vaping because " TheY OwN JuuL!! " Juul is an extremely small part of the industry that has continuously fucked over the rest of the industry by marketing to children and not giving a fuck what happens with their devices. They also charge out the ass for juice that\'s worth about 0000.2¢. Juul is for people who don\'t know anything about vaping or just want to jump on a bandwagon to look cool in front of their friends. And that\'s perfectly fine  it\'s great to have an easy usable option for smokers who just want to try a vape without getting into it in the deep end. But regardless Juul has sabotaged the industry on multiple occasions on purpose and doesn\'t give a fuck. They make an exponential amount more off of tobacco than they do selling devices and juices. The profit margins on tobacco are higher and there no real choice. You find the brand/pack you like and you\'ll continue to buy them until you die. Vaping is an ever-changing industry and it\'s really unlikely that people would vape juuls for 20 years or longer. They find a new device that they want to try or a flavor they want and they move on to something better. And Blu is in the exact same boat. Not to mention Blu basically only serves to keep people away from vaping because their products suck major ass and are unappealing once you try them.  you will think vaping isn\'t as good as cancer sticks are and that vaping is all the same. Most older/uninformed people wont actually go into a vape shop. They stop at 7/11 and see a Blu and are like " fuck it I\'ll try one of those " and then they don\'t like it and assume those are all that vaping is. Have you ever seen a Blu device in an actual vape shop ? I haven\'t. Not to mention they still make vastly more off of tobacco products. If the tobacco industry really wanted to get into vaping they could pretty much buy every company they want to outright. The amount of money tobacco companies have are absolutely rediculous. None of this is based on real evidence and recent studies have shown that the actual amount of children who vape on a consistent basis is much lower than they like to say and were already smoking before. A majority of teenage vapers dont even use juices with nicotine. The tobacco industry is rooted so deep in the states pockets that they will do anything to keep the money flowing and stay in the good graces of that hand that feeds them. We\'ve already seen multiple gov. who\'s legislation is directly tied to  tobacco influence/money. And no one will do anything about it because it\'s the norm. Prohibition does absolutely nothing. The black market will spread like a plague and thousands more will die a preventable death which they will use to further push the agenda. This has nothing to do with public health/safety. It has everything to do with money', 'Literally had a colleague tell me in the break room this morning "You still vaping? \\*laughs\\* Man, that shit is going to kill you". Just walked off and ignored his ignorance.', 'It’s so true. This popcorn lung nonsense is all propaganda at worst, misinformation at best.  No cases have been found if vaping directly relating to popcorn lung.  And that’s according to Cancer Research UK, not the homeless guy behind the liquor store.', 'Frankly I think there is a vested interest in pushing the "it\'s big tobacco" narrative we see above. Not to get into a pointless left/right politics debate (Republicans wouldn\'t be above doing it) but I bet it\'s awfully convenient that those who make money off of cigarettes happen to be Democrat (ie California\'s state government) and Democrats happen to be very anti-big tobacco in general. They can easily misdirect otherwise righteous anger through their lemmings.', "The attacks on the vaping industry, similar to the prohibition of cannabis (particularly hemp), are the result of several huge industries feeling threatened by a very disruptive product. I see these two as being two very similar sets of circumstances. \n\nThe justification for banning cannabis in full was laid at the feet of marijuana specifically and yet hemp got dragged along for reasons AND more importantly hemp (despite being arguably more beneficial in every way than marijuana) became the back burner issue. People in general have clamored for legalized marijuana at far higher rates than hemp historically. The focus has been imo deliberately funneled onto legalizing marijuana (the less disruptive counterpart to hemp) rather than hemp or cannabis in full. \n\nSimilar to the previous example nicotine vaping is being dragged along with it's less disruptive counterpart THC vaping. The justification for going after nicotine vaping stems from THC vaping. In the former example we have the benefit of hindsight and can examine the full process from start to finish. As for vaping we're currently in the middle of it but I would not be surprised if this all plays out in a very similar way. I also wouldn't be surprised if the attention rightfully turns to THC cartiridges soon leading to a new crackdown on THC products in which nicotine vaping will be dragged along with due to the current conflation being established between the two. \n\nThe biggest difference as I see it between the vape ban and cannabis ban is that one of the largest industries in our country (tobacco) has large investments in this current disruptive product, vaping. That will be the thing that keeps it alive whereas hemp flatlined. However, established tobacco companies will end up with the keys to the kingdom and will then help Gov't establish guidelines for the industry that create a barrier to entry far too high for new competitors to enter the market. When's the last time a new cigarette company entered the game that wasn't a subsidiary of the big 2 or 3? \n\nAlso I should note that thankfully the current administration has made growing hemp in the US legal at the federal level but most states still outlaw it.\n\nEdits: spelling, phrasing, formatting.", 'Since it is well documented that cigarettes and cigars are " hazardous to your health ", then why aren\'t they banned? Young people still smoke cigarettes despite the regulation and monitoring of stores which sell tobacco products. Tobacco use and the vaping of harmful THC are just symptoms of a greater problem. In order for children, teens, and even older adults to make healthier choices, wouldn\'t it make more sense to teach healthy self- care practices and provide therapies which focus on the management of extreme emotions, stress, and aberrant behaviors, i.e. Dialectical Behavioral Therapy  (DBT), instead of spending all this time, effort, and money on banning flavored ejuice. Another important area that needs attention which can encourage healthy choices is the provision of supportive home environments and greater opportunities for family therapy. If a person, child or otherwise, is emotionally and physically healthy there\'s a greater possibility that the practices of smoking tobacco and/or adulterated THC vaping will decrease. From my personal experience, I\'ve stopped smoking cigarettes after 44 yrs. By changing to vaping I\'ve been able to decrease my nicotine level from 24mg to 3mg. Flavored ejuice is probably the most important aspect of vaping that keeps me from returning to cigarettes. I also am a DBT graduate and participate group therapy. I\'m more emotional and physically healthy and make wiser life choices. It is possible for anyone.', 'Lol first thing I’ve read that is accurate on how college kids feel about vaping.

I finished a basic infographic/starter guide. Hopefully it can help some people looking to switch to vaping for New Years resolutions!|*|['I feel like NO ONE ever mentions to beginners how different levels of nicotine vape, and it also differs hugely to each device. When vaping on a large RBA or RDA 18ml would wreck my throat, I vape at 3-6mg. But when using a smaller pen style device 13-18mg is fine. Also when I started vaping I kept messing around thinking my vape was too hot when I was really just too high of a nicotine content.  \n\nEdit: Because it looks like I made the top post, I would like to take the chance to at least explain to any noobies a little more in depth what I wish someone told me! When I first started vaping, I wanted something that made big clouds, had a cool(not too hot) vape, and enough nicotine to keep me from craving. I knew this was possible, I had used an old co-workers mechmod once before and really enjoyed it. I got 26650 Mod and a big TOBH Atty, plus an ohmeter+kanthal and started learning and building away. It seemed to me like no matter what I did the vape was too hot or too harsh, but if I went too high in resistance(ohms) the vape just sucked. I couldn\'t figure out what I was doing wrong and any time I went to a B&M I would say it was too hot or harsh and I wanted it cooler, they\'d just say to "try a higher gauge wire, add more wraps, try new juices" Yada yada yada. It took me a good 2-3 weeks to figure out TWO very important things for myself that made me enjoy vaping oh so much more. AIRFLOW, the drip tip I had, and the drip tips I see around at most B&M\'s were way to small. They all may fit a 510 connection but many of them have tiny little funnels for the air to travel through causing it to restrict a lot of air. Second was nicotine level. I kept thinking my vape was too hot when really it was too harsh. There is a difference. To any newbies out there, if it seems too hot/harsh to you, especially on the exhale, the likely reason is that your vaping too high of a Nic level for your setup. I found out that with my Tobh(I\'ve tried many more RBA\'s and RDA\'s at this point and daily a Doge now) I could take HUGE mouth to lung hits, have cool vapor, no harshness, and really enjoy my vape. I had used Crappy eGo kits etc before and vaped them with 24mg+ nic content and it seemed like no big deal, but learning how to BALANCE airflow, coil resistance, and Nicotine levels are the most important things that lead to me enjoying vaping and being able to drop the cigarettes for good. This knowledge is just a base point, but for me is what made it worth it. You can get involved in all the different flavors, mods and atomizers out there but if you don\'t really learn the craft and what YOU enjoy an what works for you then you will just keep chasing something that isn\'t there.  \nBest of luck to all of you, Merry Christmas and happy holidays! ', "That's exactly my biggest confusion as a newbie.  I bought a starter pack to test it out two weeks ago and I definitely won't go back to cigarettes.  Well,  a friend handed me the juice I use since then and it's a 18mg mix.  I guess I vape about 1,2-1.6ml at a normal day and up to 4 at a party.  \n\nI wonder if that means that I have my nicotine  input raised up,  when I was smoking 16 cigarettes with 0.9mg each before,  and not more than 30 at a night out?  \n\n\n", "Nicotine is a weird thing to teach about unless the user can try the different levels. Harshness, throat hit, and satisfaction are so subjective that it's difficult to recommend what level to start on, especially considering the varying performance of hardware. I generally tell most smokers to try 12mg (in a mouth-to-lung hit tank) and go up or down from there. ", "This is interesting, thank you for the in-depth explanation. I just got started with a provari mini with an aspire nautilus tank, now vaping mister-e's jade ice with 12mg nicotine... it tastes great but can cause that annoying itchyness in the throat during exhalation. \n\nI've read that VG based liquids are much better and irritate the throat less... so should I try a lower nicotine level or switch to VG?", 'Here are some quick links if you are looking to buy some of the gear mentioned in the U.S. (once again, I am unaffiliated with any stores listed).

Too intense  - A real life anecdote - the small version (istick and k1/or a mini protank 3, can't remember) to smokers and they're like cool !  The bigger version (I think a nautilus mini or a silo lite by beyond vape) was, literally, laughed at.  \n\n\nA store should do that actually.  I'm sure they'd sell like crazy ", 'Great ideas. There\'s just so much information about vaping that can be learned. I tried to cut things down as much as I could, so other 201/301 installments might be necessary. \n\n\nI agree with saying "this is the one thing you should get" but I also believe in giving choice, so I\'m torn there. ', "I've found that people (especially older smokers) cough... a lot when they first start. This was the biggest turn-off when trying to get interested people to switch to e-cigs. I think it has to do not really with the harshness of the vapor, but the fact that you're basically inhaling moisture, which feels different and needs time to get acclimated to.", "One of the most straight forward guides to vaping. Even this subs faq is confusing to a novice (although I do note that I can't offer better!) ", 'I feel like someone trying out vaping for the first time should try at least one premium juice to see what vaping can be should they so decide to go get that kind of juice. I mean VW is fine but go to a B&M and just try some.', "I agree. I don't like recommending $.60/ml juice for a newbie ordering online. If they hate it then they wasted money.

Haven't heard of the second one.", "Thank you for this me and my wife are considering vaping and this wI'll definitely help. How does the price compare to smoking?  We are about a pack a day smokers as it is. Thanks for any and all help.", "You are welcome. The initial price can be a bit scary ~ $50-70 to get started on something good. If you choose a low cost vendor such as vapewild for liquid, it can be much cheaper than smoking cigs in the long run, depending on how much you vape obviously. A lot of us have turned it in to a hobby and enjoy high end handmade devices with specially crafted e-liquid. You certainly wouldn't be saving money that way, but there is a whole world of options!", 'Thanks man. I love vaping and vapers so much!', 'Nicely done!

I keep my vape at about 3.9 voltage and have found the Aspire Nautilus a much better tank for the price. It has great flavor and I actually had to turn the voltage down it hit so well. An important thing to remember is get a tank for your mod. Almost any vape store will help you as best they can but it also helps them if you know what you need. Don't walk in needing a tank and blame them for letting you buy a single coil if you need a double. I see this all the time and it's honestly not their fault that you don't know what you need.", "thanks. i just bought my first one last night but i'm glad to see the MVP 20W was a good choice. i also had no idea i had to get coils, ill pick some up at the local vape shop.\n\nactually, can i recommend that others go check out their local den? i was surprised to see the prices there were the same as online, for both e-liquid and tanks. sure as hell beats waiting for a package and paying shipping. i think i made a new friend too.", "THIS IS AMAZING!!

They had amazing air filters in the smoking rooms, and I never smelled cigarettes, which makes getting a smoking room easy.\n\nI really believe in holding conventions in venues that are pro-vaping, and we need to try our best to get in writing that vaping will be allowed in the areas that vaping is planned. I\'m currently looking into putting on our first event, and that will be a big part of selecting the venue.\n\nIf the convention center is a associated with a hotel, waiting for the first fire alarm to happen may not be an option, because of the fines and cost of response. In many states, a fire department has to respond and "clear" things in all areas of the hotel before they can call off emergency responders and evacuation. So finding venues that allow vaping and are familiar with their own policies and the local fire marshall codes is really important. \n\nI give big props to the VaperCon West guys and gals who researched Venues and found the Peppermill for the first year, and props to every attendee who complied and showed respect for their rules to have us allowed back.\n\nFor those traveling to out of town events, if you plan to vape inside the convention, I highly recommend looking into it ahead of time.

No cravings (maybe some habitual things I missed at first, but that's now gone too).\n\nAs for cost - for me it costs about a 3rd of smoking - even my initial layout was less than what I spent per month on smoking.\n\nAnd you have all the added benefits, your lungs clear up, your sense of smell and taste comes back and no more smelly ashtrays, clothes and hair - my car now has a faint scent of vanilla as opposed to sun heated, stale smoke and ash", "I'll let everyone else fill you in on the inexpensive models, but if you're interested in a setup like what's pictured on the sidebar:\n\nThat's a [Sigelei ZMAX](http://www.tropicalvapors.com/Sigelei-ZMax--Advanced-Personal-Vaporizer_p_110.html) with a [Kanger ProTank](http://www.discountvapers.com/kanger-protank-clear-glass-economy-packing/) on top.  If you'd like to jump to that kit immediately, you'll also need to buy flat-top 18650 batteries and a high-quality charger (both available as add-ons at that ZMAX link).  After that, you'll need juice - I would recommend hitting [Mt. Baker Vapor](http://www.mtbakervapor.com/) and getting a selection of small bottles in various flavors, nicotine concentrations, and viscosities (PG/VG ratio) to quickly figure out what will work best for you.  \n\nQuick tips: Have backups for everything.  Batteries die, coils burn out, and juice spills.  Keep plenty of water around - vaping can really dry you out.  Whatever you order, hit YouTube to find videos to show you how to use it.  It's awesome to open Vape Mail and just hit the ground running.\n\nAs for effective, I smoked for over 20 years in the half-a-pack to pack-a-day range.  I tried a small kit (like the picture you posted) and I was able to cut down, but I was still vaping along with smoking.  I got an eGo starter kit.  After about a week of using it, as an experiment, I decided to see if I could get by without smoking.  That was in January, and I haven't had a cigarette since.  I started at 24mg nicotine and I'm down to 18mg already with a feeling that I could probably drop to 12mg with no issues.

She pretty much gave up on it and went back to real cigs, since when she needed a puff often times her damn battery was dead. She is sick of the smell, and wants to switch to e-cigs, but hasn't had any luck as of yet.\n\nAlso, and this may be the stupidest question ever, are there a such thing as like nicotine free e-cigs? I like the act of smoking, but I am not really looking to get addicted to anything. Silly I know, but just throwing it out there.", "I think the easiest set-up is this:\n\nBattery: [eGo-C Twist](http://www.mtbakervapor.com/joyetech-ego-twist-variable-voltage-battery/) (I would buy two if possible, since you can charge one while vaping with the other) or the [eGo passthrough](http://www.mtbakervapor.com/smoktech-passthrough-900-mah/) (This allows you to charge it via miniUSB *while you vape!*)\n\n[Charger](http://www.mtbakervapor.com/smoktech-ego-charging-bundle/)\n\nTank/clearomizer: [Kanger MT3](http://www.mtbakervapor.com/kanger-t3-rebuildable-clearomizer/?attributes=eyIxMDY3IjoiMzI5In0) - Really easy to fill up and produces a great, consistent vape each time.\n\n[Replacement coils for clearomizer](http://www.mtbakervapor.com/kanger-t3-mt3-replacement-coil/) - Each one should last at least two weeks before needing replacement (you'll know). Get as many as you need at first.\n\n[Nicotine juice](http://www.mtbakervapor.com/electronic-cigarette-nicotine-juice/) - Any flavor you like. I'd recommend getting a few small bottles with varying flavors, nicotine concentrations and PG/VG ratios to see what you like most.\n\nThe whole set shouldn't cost you more than around $80. After that point the only thing you need to spend money on is juice and replacement coils, which will only set you back about $20 a month.\n\n\n\n\n\n", 'The community helps just as much as the ecigs do.  Call it a circle jerk if you want, but interacting with others who are excited about vaping keeps you excited about vaping.', "Coming here really helped me get started.  After coming here I started viewing vaping as a hobby and it became a whole lot more appealing to me.  I didn't *just* want to quit smoking anymore, I wanted to try out new juices and gear.  I realized I was *actually* excited when a package came with a bunch of new flavors or a new tank.\n\n\nIt sounds lame but this community really helped me quit while never preaching that I needed to quit. I am not fond of the occasional smoker bashing on here but for the most part, much of the community seems to be of the opinion that it's not the cigarettes you smoke that matter; it's the ones you don't.  That's a message that makes smokers feel welcome.", "Hey, alcoholics have AA and drug addicts have things like NA.  Smokers don't have things like that.  We're a (generally) positive community who is 1. enthusiastic about the fact that we're not smoking anymore 2. willing to do anything we can to help you do the same and 3. likes to spend money on shiny things and likes to show off when we get them.", "I've seen *tons* of people's opinions of eCigs ruined by Blu and NJoy. It's infuriating. Every time some one new talks to me about ecigs I get the same thing. \n>them: Yeah I tried them I just don't like it.\n\n>me: Oh nah man, you just gotta try a good one!\n\n>them: No no this was one of the good ones.\n\n>me: Oh, ok. /sigh\n\nMore often than not they have no idea what kind it was. If they do, it was blu or njoy.\n\nWhat's worse is, I'll let them try mine (1300mah ego-c twist w/iClear 30) and they'll pull super hard and draw it straight in and either choke on it or not know how to get any vapor.\n\nVaporizing flavored liquid nicotine is **so much more enjoyable than smoking tobacco**, I honestly think that anyone given a **proper** sample of a delicious flavor of their choice in a well functioning ego tank (or better), they would immediately switch.\n\nIf there's any advice I could give to a newcomer/first timer, it's this;\n\n* Draw smoothly and slowly, not like you're sucking on a straw. Fill your mouth with it and then inhale. You're producing vapor, not drawing fire closer to you.\n* Don't just buy some piece of shit random thing at a gas station. A good electronic cigarette often comes in multiple pieces, possibly from multiple websites\n* If you're not choosing your own liquid flavors and nicotine strengths, you're doing it wrong. Pre-filled cartomizers (little things full of cotton that hold liquid, as opposed to tanks, which have loose liquid and wicks) are a waste of money and resources. You're paying to use something once that can be used multiple times.\n\nIf you really want that 'package/brand/kit' experience instead of scouring the net for good parts, being disappointed, and trying again, a good place to start is [Halo Cigs](http://www.halocigs.com/triton-tank-system.html). That link is to their Triton tank system, which has received a lot of great reviews, including some from people who are used to much more expensive, high level systems. Their G6 kit is also great from my experience, and is often more comfortable and easy for new users to get used to. The downsides of that sort are that adding liquid to small cartomizers involves a lot of leaking, which ruins the battery, and the battery doesn't last *nearly* as long. An ego system (like Triton) has a much bigger battery that will generally last significantly longer.\n\nBut most importantly, I'd say **do not rest your opinion on eCigs on your experiences with gas station systems**", 'Why do people hate on njoy? Honestly, that shit is the strongest nicotine I ever smoked at 4.5%. The taste me be blah, but the strength is intense. ', "I want to be honest with you: You may have to get used to it. It's nor a cigarette after all (and that's good ;))\n\nThere are several things in cigs which are also addictive not only the nicotine. Some people have cravings when they first try to switch, some do not. After some time I can say, yeah I'm quite satisfied by now. No ash, no bad smell, you can still inhale something that looks like smoke, you still get your nicotine fix and so on. Try it, you don't have anything to lose :)", "Hell I don't smoke cigarettes nor do I want to quit smoking Cigars and Pipes... but I love vaping zero nic fluids!!\n", 'What i hate is i stop smoke real cigs almost a year ago but my family keep saying im smoke. I explain to them its not smoking and they say well its just another addiction. Im proud of myself and thats all that matters.', 'Point out that there is nothing burning so there is no smoke ;)\n\nBut you are right and should be proud of yourself!', "Ask em how much coffee, tea, or caffeinated soda they drink.  Caffeine is an addictive substance, too.  No, it's not healthy, but it is *much* healthier than smoking.  It's all about harm reduction until you're at a point where you can quit completely and quitting straight nicotine is *way* easier than quitting cigarettes, according to the plethora of anecdotal data out there, including on this sub.\n\nAnd you should be proud of yourself.  You done one of the hardest things you can ever hope to do by quitting smoking cigarettes.  I did it in three days after an 18 year 1.5ppd habit.  I loved smoking.  Everything about it was appealing except for the harm, but the shit in the tobacco had such a stronghold on me that no other method of quitting worked.

A very nice redditor sent me a pm saying he had a lot of gear and juice he could part with, sent him my address and got the package in a few days.\n\nIt had an odd connection (401) but I didnt know anything about it. Ended up taking the cotton out of the cartidges, and dripping the fluid straight onto the metal piece on the atomizer...loved it.\n\nSearched this subreddit and the rest is history, I wont get too much into my setup, but soon and for cheap i was getting PLOOMS of wonderful tasting vapor, with a high nicotine content.\n\nWoke up one morning and went to smoke a cigarette.

I\'m sick of smelling bad around my boyfriend and family, and sad that it\'s *still* not enough motivation for me to kick the habit. I\'m at a place in life where I have an excess of stress and a shortage of money, which made it all the more difficult to kick my relatively cheap form of immediate relief. \n\nBut I\'ve only been perusing this subreddit for an hour or so, and I already feel encouraged.

THE TRUTH|*|["I approve of the intent here as a former smoker that vapes instead.  However, shitty images with false information only hurt things.  'Vitamin E has the ability to integrate on membranes' <<<WTF do you even know how to integrate?", "That, and nicotine liquid is not yet regulated by the FDA.  It's *going* to be, but it isn't yet.\n\nIt is, however, a legal substance in all 50 states, where THC isn't.  And as such, there is legal recourse against the manufacturer and/or the shop that sold you the juice, so it is in the manufacturer's best interest to make things right, vs. cutting like the black market THC stuff.  That's the whole underlying cause, after all. Illegal THC is expensive so dealers will cut it if they can.  Prior to vitamin E acetate, cut THC was clearly obvious as it was thinner, but vitamin E acetate is a thick liquid with a golden color just like THC, making it the perfect agent to mix in with cut THC to thicken it back up and look like you're getting the full product you thought you were paying for.  Instead, you got death.\n\nThat, and even shoddy nicotine juice makers (in-house makers who just slop stuff around in a back office, juice that's clearly been contaminated with insects, etc) aren't putting in stuff that can kill you (well, usually -- I'm looking at you, Cuttwood and your attempts to sell juice with titanium dioxide).  And when bad things happen, the community and the market doesn't hesitate in calling out the bad actors.  Because it's legal.\n\nThe theme here is THC vaping is dangerous because it's illegal, not because it's inherently dangerous.  Thus the best way to prevent people from dying from THC vaping is to legalize marijuana, not illegalize nicotine vaping.", "It's sick how many people believe the media. I had to correct my doctor and give her hard facts. The new England journal of medicine published a bs article claiming e juice created formaldehyde yet the test was done in an empty tank with a coil of unknown material, heated until it smoked and created a trace amount of one type of formaldehyde. That didn't work well so now on to blaming all vapes for making people sick. Smh I've vaped for 3 years and haven't coughed or felt sick once. Big tobacco is losing money and I'm sure they're lobbying millions to the media outlets to spread this propaganda.", "I love to subscribe to conspiracy theories.   What I think this is is the confluence of news organizations finding a villain and milking it for ratings.   \n\nYou read the dubious headline and they conflate the issue of e cigarettes and thx carts.   The body of the article raises the concern that it could be thc carts but the headline is designed to create controversy.\n\nWe have national anti smoking organizations with nothing to do.   The last percentage of smokers is going to be difficult to convince to quit, so you have a party in power which doesn't have much to do and needs a new enemy.   They are brought in as experts and given a podium and conflate the two issues.   \n\nAdd to that the anger some people have with youth vaping.   I hate it too.   Kids are making stupid choices.   They have made stupid choices for generations.   But it looks terrible and angers adults who see the youth vaping.  \n\nNews organizations make money on controversy.    The confluence of experts with nothing to do, stupid kids, and an incorrect headline has given these news organizations controversy which sells.  They love this shit.   Remember they're a business , and their business is for ratings.   \n\nThey don't care about spreading misinformation because they can brilliantly conflate issues and no one will question them.", 'A friend of mine on Facebook said she is giving up vaping due to all the hype, and I gave a simple reply of "just buy your shit from reputable places". Another friend of mine who knows I\'ve been vaping for years said "If telijah ain\'t dead yet, then it is all fear mongering".', 'My fucking eye doctor made a comment on Friday when I had an exam and my paperwork said I Vaped daily. He asked if I wasn’t worried with all the deaths going on. I go on to explain that almost all are actually related to bootleg cartridges usually containing thc instead of nicotine or their just bootleg nic juice. I tell him that until thc is legalized in the states this is happening in, you WILL have dirty Joe mixing his “zombie juice” in his bathtub and making cartridges to fill the demand that exists. Legalizing and regulating all products would stop that problem immediately. It’ll also bring in some tax money.', "I've been making THC vapes for 2 years. Vitamin E Acetate = Chinese vape juice used to dilute THC distillate without thinning it like other agents (Terps, PG, VG). They have always been extremely vague about what was in these thcikener products, and anyone who cares about what they were making did NOT use that shit", "The Vitamin E is on excarcerbating the problem, even vaping MCT can cause lipid pneumonia. \n\nInhaling any oil is bad practise.\n\nThat's why it's insane that there's people producing vaping liquids with actual oils and not terpenes or PG/VG.\n\nLike fire breather's pneumonia has been known about for a century. And you can get that by simply inhaling whatever oil you use to breathe fire.\n\n\n\nSo if you are only vaping THC infrequently you won't even notice the minimal amounts of oil settling in your lungs, but if you are a heavy daily user even MCT without any Vitamin A antioxidants will gunk up your lungs and cause lipid pneumonia.", "1. We don't know for sure it is only illegal THC oil, but it is most likely the main cause.\n\n2. The main persons that have lead ME to believe it was 'vapes' in general were the teens that most likely used the illegal THC oils, and then lied about it, coupled with the fact that they blame nicotine cartidges.", 'From my personal experience in trying to DIY my own THC ejuice about 6 years ago leads me to believe this is explicitly related to THC carts.\n\nI used an RSO method to extract the THC. After having the concentrate, I would drip some directly onto my coil and vape. Delicious! It worked, but it was quick to burn up and gunk my coils. I could add it to the juice, but it seemed the PG was not a good vehicle for the THC like it is for nicotine. Also, if it sat for more than a day or two it would fall out of suspension, and just hang out in the bottom of the bottle.\n\nTHC binds to fats. It\'s why butters and oils are commonly used to make edibles. How many THC-filled watermelons do you see on the shelves? So my thought was to use an oil, which I had coconut oil available, suspend the THC and combine that with some flavor, and some VG. It worked, but tasted like shit. It lasted about a week.\n\nFrom there I gave up and just went to making tinctures, little known to me I was saving my pulmonary functions.\n\nThe point is, from my experience, you can\'t have THC in suspension without oil. The oil, when vaped, condenses in your lungs. The vapor comes out, oil doesn\'t. You absorb the THC, so you\'re still getting high, just not releasing the oils. So you do more carts, keep getting high, and continue filling your bronchial track with oil.\n\nNicotine doesn\'t require the use of lipids to act as a vehicle, so it isn\'t used. To be honest, I\'m unsure if nicotine CAN be delivered via oils; I\'m not a chemist. But for people to be using ecigs exclusively for over a decade and not hearing about this uptick in pulmonary disease, there had to be a change in the market. It would seem it would have been either the nic salts which have seen a rise in popularity or THC carts.\n\nI guess only time will really tell. If the bans occur in the US as it seems on track to happen, we\'ll be finding out in a few years if it is related to current ecig composition or something else. I have a feeling the PG/VG/Nicotine will be harder to obtain, so people will get creative in finding methods to circumvent the systems. Similar to me in the beginning of this post, experimenting with different formulas to find the best possible and passable method. This is where we will see an uptick of non-THC cart related pulmonary disease and the public shift will be pointed back to ecigs and be demonized even more.\n\nIf anyone has their doubts, I implore them to look at the current restrictions on cannabis and the amount of people who turned to spice, or the restrictions on LSD and the amount of people who turned to 25C-NBOMe, or the restrictions on cocaine and the amount of people who turned to bath salts. Each of these illegal drugs can be safely used and enjoyed, but their "legal" (or more readily available) counterparts are more toxic and often more legal. This is why the world needs decriminalization of drugs, safe spaces to use those drugs, with resources like social workers and drug counseling to help break the addiction cycle.', 'WHY ARE YOU YELLING AT ME?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Your lungs are great at pushing air, but not fluid. With the oils building in your lungs, it will leave them working harder to get the same amount of oxygen in. Essentially, pneumonia.\n\nI was talking to a pulmonologist recently who mentioned that about 50 years ago there was a rise in this same type of oil-based pneumonia. People would drink a spoon full of mineral oils to act as a laxative, typically before bed. When they would lie down, the oil that coated the mouth and throat would trickle down into the lungs. When people stopped with the nightly oils, the pneumonia cases decreased.\n\nThe THC carts use Vitamin E to deliver the THC as PG/VG does not make successful, long term solution. With the rise of cannabis and the consumer wanting affordable and discreet products, the market quickly adapted to the first viable product. Now that we know the oils are the problem, it will be back to the drawing board to figure in what can be done to have the product not kill people. Unfortunately, ecigs have been rolled into that umbrella, and instead of properly funding research it will all just get banned, forcing people to continue to use the products that kill as there is no incentive to make ones that don't.", '6 people die from vaping.

PSA: The truth about zample box|*|["AdamFear - ZampleBox is a sampling service that works by providing vapers with access to juices at up to 70% off retail prices so there is less risk when trying new products for the first time.

We sell to consumers at wholesale prices, so we certainly aren't buying at wholesale prices.\n\nWhen working with our partners and ordering 60,000 bottles, everyone wins. Manufactures make small margins but a large increase in volume, amazing exposure, cost effective marketing. \n\nSorry you don't like my taste in cars, but you should know that the Porsche cost less than a new Honda. :)", " > I was unable to find any valid US business with the name Clear Creek Liquid\n\nI was able to find the company CLEAR CREEK LIQUID, LLC on the Washington Secretary of State company search.

Are we talking about those tutorials where you can squeeze ejuice out of a smokers curtains?', "Tony from ZB here. I am not sure what the revelation or discovery here is or how it has any relevance to ZampleBox. ZampleBox and  Clear Creek were completely separate organizations (I say “were” because CC isn’t even around anymore). I would love to know what point is trying to be made here. If the point is to show that I, Tony, (not ZampleBox, but myself as an individual) have ownership in multiple companies… then, yes you are 100% correct. How is that a bad thing? And how is it possibly a bad thing that I have ownership in a domain called Vape Amazing? I'm sure lots of members on ECR own a lot of domain names. I just don't follow the point of this or why is in any way bad.\n\nI feel that *my personal* actions and interests are being **completely** mistaken for *ZampleBox’s* actions and interests. \n\nI, Tony (not ZampleBox), am involved in **many** businesses other than ZampleBox (as is the case with most entrepreneurs). That includes vaping related companies and also non-vaping related companies just as **many** of my peers in the industry are (the list of my peers with multiple vaping companies is longer than the list of those with one). \n\nI, Tony,  (**not** ZampleBox) had an ownership interest in Clear Creek before it was shut down. This was in exchange for the capital I put up to fund the vision for the company. I also have ownership in Vape Amazing, ZampleTrader (coming soon), PeerVape (coming soon), a balsamic company, an app development company and several other startup ventures. That does **not** mean ZampleBox has an ownership in those entities, that means that I, Tony, do and there is nothing wrong with working hard and having multiple companies. \n\nClear Creek is no longer in operation and all of the remarks I’ve said have been factual and honest. If you read the AMA, you’ll see that. **There is no partnership between Clear Creek and ZampleBox at this time nor will there be in the future because CC is no longer in operation**. I also have stated several times in the AMA that ZB *was* partnered with Clear Creek and ZB provided the creative and marketing services while CC provided liquid production. This is 100% factual. \n\n\n\nThe relationship between ZB and CC is clearly stated in the AMA by the ZB team: http://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/2zqxhi/ama_zamplebox_team_here_to_answer_all_of_your/ . It is 100% factual. \n\nI still don’t know why we are even talking about CC or how it is relevant. Their products aren’t in ZB and they aren’t affiliated with ZB as they aren’t even a company anymore. \n\nIn any case, I have been asked a lot of questions in the last 24 hours and have answered them truthfully, so I think it’s only fair if I get to ask a question: \n\n**Yes, I, Tony, (not ZampleBox) have ownership in several companies which include CC (before it closed) and Vape Amazing, why is this a bad thing and how is it at all relevant to ZampleBox especially when CC isn’t even affiliated with ZampleBox anymore?**\n\nBest,\n\nTony \n\nFounder @ ZB\n", 'You pumping out your own "personal" company\'s ejuice into zample box is a problem. You flooded the market with cheap juice made from a company you own to cut prices of your zample box.

I\'ve given you MULTIPLE chances to admit to your involvement in Clear Creek and each time you have given me not the full story not half of it by a small portion, at first it was just buying ejuice, then it was doing web development and product logo design, now you\'ve admitted to ownership in the company. Your lies are the cause of this, your poor business ethics and blatant disrespect for your consumers.\n\nClear Creek was never a startup company to help up and coming juice makers. It was always a shell company to give you plausible deniability to not making your own ejuice. If there was any truth to CC being a company for good and not a zamplebox tool there would have been no reason to hide it, no reason intentional lie to me and all your customers. And there would have been lots of reason to publicly pimp the company to receive more support. Instead you created a scape goat, a company you could pump money into making ejuice and "trading" it to zamplebox for web design work; on a company that had next to no web traffic, no way to sell 99% of the products and exclusively wholesaled to your own company zample box.\n\nJust because "zample box" did not make its own juice does not mean you did not put your own juice lines in the box.

Time.Com - Vaping Is 95% Healthier and 40% Cheaper Than Smoking|*|['vaping should be much cheaper than just 40%, if it weren\'t for the overpriced juices..  the "premium" ejuice standard of $20/30ml originated at a time when all vaping goods were overpriced.  Little tube Mods back then were $300 standard... luckily chinese manufacturers have stabilized the mod prices, but the ejuice prices remained the same...   \n\nalso \n\n>The study, which was not funded by the tobacco lobby but rather the U.K.’s Department of Health\n\nglad there are still some reputable news sources that is not blind', 'Also the $20/30ml "standard" came about during a time of lower powered devices, where the typical user was using about 1-3ml/day to supplant a pack/day smoking habit. \n\nWith the mass-market popularity of sub-ohm/high watt devices, that same user is going through 5-10ml/day. The economics are greatly in favor of suppliers, retail consumers are getting the shaft. ', 'UK dept of health is probably trying to figure out how much tax to levy on vape stuff.  I bet its 40%.', "I think the factor of how much money you save is rather tricky when there are many people who have the budget and find it a hobby. There is definitely a good amount of people who can't help but want the new toy and so end up with a huge collection of constantly growing devices/atomizers/juices.\n\nAlso, if the non-US people can correct me if I'm wrong (it's the internet, you are always wrong) but I heard that juice can get quite pricey everywhere else in the world. Not many countries have access to places like Vapewild without spending a lot on shipping.\n\nBut then again, there are people like me. Can't afford to get the new shiny so the IPV mini 2 will be the only device for quite awhile. At the end of the day though, as long as we keep off cigs, it's all good!", 'There people buying $20/30ml juices are begging taken. I pay $35/20ml. Sure it\'s not marketed as "premium" ejuice but I can\'t tell the difference', "40% seems like a good average. Hell when I was buying premium juice and changing atomizer every 3 days it was costing me almost more then smoking a pack a day! Then I switched to unflavored vg with 3-5% juice I'm spending penny's a day. With almost no sweeteners and straight vg my coils are lasting weeks. Plus I started wrapping my own coils + venturing into DIY I'm now vaping for almost nothing! And enjoying it more then ever! Unfortunately I learned about a place called fasttech...and I may have spent a few extra bucks lol. ", "Guy at work switch from smoking to vaping.  He treats it like a hobby though.  Every month he has a new rig, then bitches it's too expensive and he's going to go back to cigs. ", "Holy crap, so if it was more than a pack a day and assuming you spent $10 a day, that's $300 a month... There's something weird about that. I mean, granted I just starting building my own coils and stuff but a $20 bottle of ejuice lasts me at least a week and I maybe change my coils every few weeks, at least until they start tasting funky. So I'm basically spending $85ish a month when cigarettes would be around $150+ a month. That pretty much falls in line with the average percent stated in the article.  \n  \nEdit: I also tend to pick up bottles for $15 or $10 most of the time which further reduces the costs. In my option, a 30ml bottle shouldn't be more than $20 ever but hey, people like money. ", "I've red this in the beginning of the week, slept couple of nights on this, changed my mind and have quit smoking on Thursday. I could feel the difference after 3 hours, the workout on my bike was much easier.

Now with DIY and rebuildables I spend less than $15 a month.', "I bought a liter of just that I'm about half way through for $150 three months ago. $150 for 6 months and maybe $100 on coils is a about what I spend on cigarettes in a month (pack a day, $8.00 American Spirits). Vaping is currently saving my wallet by about 80%!", "As far as cheaper goes, I'm saving 400 a month, as a previous pack a day smoker. ", 'I go through 2-3 ml per day and if I buy the cheapest liquid I pay per week now what I paid per day before when smoking. Of course add equipment and the savings go down a bit. Still far cheaper.', 'Everyone here seems to be confused by the 40% thing. \n\nThe article clearly states that this number is for disposable e-cigarettes. Before going on to refillables.\n\n"If you really want to get that cost down, you can sacrifice some convenience and buy a reusable vape with liquid refills, getting the cost down to about $500 to $600 per year—an average savings of over $2,000."\n\nThat aside, the big problem with this article is the inane and naive end comment that smokers would be better to kick it altogether. On what grounds, fuckwit? Vaping being 95% healthier than smoking makes it healthier than junk food: what\'s the problem? Furthermore, it completely misses the fucking point: to denigrate the most effective anti-smoking aid EVER simply because it\'s not cold turkey is fucking inane and dangerous. It\'s better that people quit to something virtually harmless than try for something only slightly better and never fucking get there.', ">That aside, the big problem with this article is the inane and naive end comment that smokers would be better to kick it altogether.\n\nAre you arguing that vaping is safer than not vaping?

In the meantime, Russian Federation Council are about to launch campaign to ban E-Cigs completely, since "E-cigarettes make smoking look tasty and cool and are even more hazardous to health than regular smoking".\n\nAnd I\'m just about to buy my first e-cig next week.', 'Where the hell is the 95% stat coming from all the media outlets are using?\n\n>If you really want to get that cost down, you can sacrifice some convenience and buy a reusable vape with liquid refills, getting the cost down to about $500 to $600 per year\n\nYep I only spent that much... yeah...totally... ;_;', 'I recently started vaping to quit smoking. I do enjoy the cheapness and cleaner feeling lungs. But damnit it is not even close to as satisfying as smoking a No.27 cigarette.', 'If you\'re using a cig-alike or a cheap pen-type vape, it\'s just not gonna match the inhale of a cigarette. I just recently switched up to a 40 watt box mod on a 1.0 ohm coil and the difference is night and day. After about 3 puffs, I said to myself "yup, I\'m probably not going to want to smoke cigs anymore." \n\nI\'ve only smoked a handful of actual cigs over the last week, and I\'ve stopped buying them already.', '40% not in bloody australia, you save about 90% if not more... when a pack of smokes can cost you $30 vaping feels like its free\n', "I'm honestly not saving much money (if any) any more, in Ontario anyways. I only smoked a pack or two a week, but juice seems to cost nearly twice as much as cigarettes did now. Not to mention hardware costs. My iStick 50w died, broke my Atlantis and my Subtank and my Arctic seems to be on its way out. Sigelei 150w seems to be going strong although it has a lot of trouble figuring out what ohms it should be at. ", "Once you know the flavours you like, Vapor North has two 100 ml bottles for $60, which isn't too bad. Dashvapes sells Mt. Baker Vapor, which is also pretty cheap. It's not great, but it is definitely vapeable. \n\nAs far as hardware goes, get a good, reliable device for home (I have a Sig 150), and get a cheap mech or an original Kbox for the road. \n\nI spent a lot of money on shitty hardware. I wish I just bought good stuff from the beginning. \n\nTo borrow a phrase from the trades, I'm not rich enough to afford cheap hardware. ", "It's a tiny minority of vapers that treat it as a hobby to spend vast amounts of money on. Even for me, a guy who knows about and has dabbled with mods etc, I've settled down with one device, found a dirt cheap source of juice and probably spend about $20-30 a month on the habit.

My perspective on the THC Vape health issues (cannabis lab director)|*|["The nicotine vaping community is having to learn a lot about the THC vaping industry quickly due to this issue.  \n\nWe've shunned the topic before because it is a separate product with its own forums. Now we have to know for safety concerns, but also just to answer knowledgeably when the topic inevitably comes up. Even with coworkers and family.  \n\nThanks for the quick lesson.

It's the weirdest mixture of 'cutting edge' and 2010 tek... We still don't have temp control devices for christsake...\n\nedit: to all the people pointing out that temp control devices like the Pax Era exist (also the dosist). You are correct, and I'm going to be straight with you I just kind of forgot it existed. That said, let me clarify by saying the VAST MAJORITY of thc vape products sold are not temp control. There are plenty of batteries that have basic power control, low/med/high settings, maybe even preheat functions. But those are not true temp control. I'm talking about nichrome or SS wire carts that allow a real temp control to take place being wide spread, and that would be fantastic for allowing patients/users to have fine tuned control of their devices and it's effects.", "I live out in Hawaii. After my parents heard about these cases on our local news stations, they sent me a text saying I should stop my bad habit soon. I did a quick research on the article and a few others and noticed they all had one thing in common...THC products...I told them that I don't vape that kind of juice and they shouldn't have to worry. But it does give regular nicotine vaping a bad name.", 'I\'ve been lucky enough to work in a pot shop through this whole thing, so I\'ve been getting updates and new information from the owners/customers.

And you're absolutely right. I had to do a lot of my own legwork trying to find the commonality. Once I did, I started educating them. And once I told them it was not only cartridges, but black market *THC* cartridges, they understood immediately that I was in no danger. I'm all for legalizing marijuana. I personally don't like it, but I'll never stand in the way of progress, especially since it's a great alternative to opioids in many cases.

We needed to differentiate terminology (and since you can\'t make other people stop using words, you can only choose your own, we should\'ve moved away from "vaping" on to something like "electronic nicotine delivery"/ENDS).  But we didn\'t, and now "vaping" is killing people, and it doesn\'t matter that it\'s THC vape because the cloud blowing, Subaru driving, "Do you even vape?" bro is such a meme of course that\'s what people think of when they hear "A kid died from vaping."

When the first stories started popping up, I said, "Well, that sounds a hell of a lot like lipid pneumonia."  The doctors are still hedging a bit, but most are saying it\'s "almost certainly" lipid pneumonia.  Which means it is.\n\nAnd I\'ve been saying that the vaping community has known about lipid pneumonia for a very long time, as it was one of the boogeymen that was used to scare people away from vaping back in the earlier days (I dipped my toe into the scene in 2009 and started vaping fulltime in 2011, and lipid pneumonia was something we all knew not to fuck around with back then).  But people tell me, "I\'ve never heard of that."  It seems as our nicotine vaping community and market matured, we forgot our history.  Like, we still call mods "mods", but do people remember why they\'re called that? (because in the early days, if you wanted something better than a cigalike, you had to make your own hardware, usually by modifying flashlight tubes, thus "mod")  And somewhere along the lines we lost our healthy fear of lipid pneumonia.  I\'m sure liquid makers never lost it (if they ever had it, anyway; I\'m not sure many of the newer manufacturers ever even thought about it, and certainly very few in-house B&M juice makers would have worried about it because their source material made it irrelevant) and were diligent about keeping oil out of our juice, but the rank and file forgot to be scared.\n\nIf the nicotine vaping community a decade ago was the wild west, the weed vaping community is far worse.  And that\'s because it\'s still illegal more places than it\'s not, as you say.  But even legal shops are playing fast and loose, in comparison to nicotine juice makers.\n\n> the average cannabis consumer, cart user, or dispensary owner will not even TOUCH Propylene Glycol. They think it\'s somewhere between hydrocholoric acid and cyanide. I don\'t understand it and I\'ve long stopped trying to educate, it\'s fucking frustrating.\n\nWhy do you think that is?  It seems strange to me, knowing what PG is (it\'s an alcohol, not an oil) and where else it\'s used (asthma inhalers), and having vaped it for years.  If I wanted to vape weed (and I\'m in a legal state, so I can do so safely), I\'d probably explicitly look for PG/VG-based vapes as MCT scares me like it scares you.', "People see the other things that PG is added in and immediately associate it with the dangers of that said product.  The most common typically being antifreeze.  There is PG in antifreeze, so these dumb as rocks people immediately associate PG with the poison that is antifreeze.

Even if you try and explain that PG has been an ingredient for dispersal od asthma inhalers and many other healthy, helpful products, people still only focus on the idea that it is an ingredient in something poisonous though.

If it comes from China isn't it all contaminated?\n\nWell, that's a complicated question. Short answer is we test them! Long answer is we test all of our incoming raw ingredients, including non cannabis ingredients (NCI's) for a full Cat 3 Panel. That includes Heavy metals, pesticides, foreign material, microbial and fungal, And comply fully with state guidelines. We of course are legally required to test again after manufacturing, same full panel in whats called a COA (certificate of analysis) and if we don't pass (and can't fix it, you usually can't) you have to destroy the batch. It's kind of a big deal, the CDPH and or BCC gets involved. We try and head that off with R&D testing to know if something is going to fail ahead of time and avoid it.\n\nAs for the carts, well we recommend clients source quality authentic components. I've yet to see one of the authentic CCells we recommend fail a heavy metal test. I've tested ones we've left sitting around for over 6mo and had them pass (though not at a non-detect). Most batches we see are a non detect or LOQ. Sometimes we get a small spike. I won't put anything out over 50% of action limit for liability reasons, way too easy for a retest to show higher and then we have the fun of a recall. NOT FUN. That said, I have seen rando carts and devices fail. We're a contract manufacturer. We work with the device the client provides more often then not. We can steer them in the right direction, but if they are hellbent on saving a buck, then on their head be it. We usually catch it in R&D testing, they eat the loss and learn their lesson. I'm very confident everything leaving our facility is safe.\n\nTruth of the matter is that poison is in the dose. The state of CA has determined that cannabis can have up to .5 ug/g (parts per billion). For comparison (and from FDA.gov)\n\nBottled Water\n\nThe FDA, through its regulatory authority under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, limits levels of lead (as well as other contaminants) in bottled water by establishing allowable levels in the quality standard for bottled water. For lead, this level is set at 5 ppb. This level is below the 15 ppb allowed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for lead in public drinking water, as the tap water standard takes into account lead that can leach from pipes.\n\nJuice and Candy\n\nThe FDA has issued recommended guidelines to industry on specific foods and drinks more likely to be consumed by small children, including limiting lead in candy to a maximum level of 0.1 ppm and in juice to 50 ppb.\n\nWhen you compare that to the max amounts in cannabis, I worry about it a lot less. I mean the juice you give your kids is allowed to have 50ppb (cannabis is .5ppb) and you sure drink a lot more OJ in a sitting than you can consume cannabis. Honestly I think the heavy metal bit is overblown. Just my opinion.\n\nIf you're curious, this dude does a great write up on it from the perspective of a testing lab director: https://www.reddit.com/r/CannabisExtracts/comments/b2d6zz/heavy_metals_what_the_hell_and_why_the_heck_part_0/", '[https://www.leafly.com/news/health/vape-pen-lung-disease-thc-oil-additive-investigation](https://www.leafly.com/news/health/vape-pen-lung-disease-thc-oil-additive-investigation)', '>With only minimal experience in terp blends and the marijuana industry in general, how many companies do you think contain the Vit E "HoneyCuts"? From what I gathered, it was quite common.\n\nWell, honeycut was by no means the only or even the most popular cut. They were just the "noisiest" on IG. Floraplex and TrueTerpenes were absolutely moving shit-tons of the stuff. \nAs far as prevelence in the industry, it\'s hard to say. On the licensed end of things, I don\'t think it\'s super common and we can see that because almost everyone that has gotten sick has gotten their cart black market. The cuts don\'t work when you have to get it tested. Even though a thickener lets me make a cart that LOOKS like it is 80-85% potency, it doesn\'t matter because the vendor won\'t touch it if it tests under 80% (it just won\'t sell). As far as getting doctored results, I don\'t know. I know we only work with top-tier labs. We actually have a rigorous qualification procedure we make labs go through before we\'ll shunt \'em any of out testing business, including hitting w/n a certain margin of error with a known potency reference samples diluted down to various levels, correctly identifying selected terpene blends, etc... The lab we work with (and I\'ll give \'em a shout out, they\'re awesome, <3 earthlabs) does NOT fuck around. They show up and select random samples out of the batch, with a gopro recording them (in addition to our HD cameras so there is redundant records of compliance). We can\'t touch anything during this process, even if it\'s not meant to be interferring. We had one pickup when the lab guy was picking up product for testing and dropped a box on the ground. One of our distro employees who was doing inventory nearby just bent over to pick it up, just being helpful, but they had to scrap the pickup, put everything back and come back the next day and re-do everything just to avoid any appearance of impropriety! \n\nFor the blackmarket guys, who knows... I think we can see it was fairly common, and the people showing up as sick are the ones that were using a lot. even if you had a badly cut cart I doubt a couple of hits would affect the average healthy adult. It wouldn\'t be good for you, but it\'s not like "puff puff dead" \n\n>Also, why do you think Marijuana has such an aversion to VG/PG? Researching the topic awhile back, it seemed that MCT oil was the common carrier of choice, though I could find no actual science stating it quickly metabolizes in the lung, due to its shorter chain chemistry. I was shocked when I found out much of the cannabis industry was pushing oil based solutions.\n\nDude, that is the million dollar question. I think it\'s a lot of factors, and I could go on about this for a lot longer than I think most of y\'all want to read. But it boils down to a lack of scientific literacy and rumors and misinformation. \nRemember that shitty formaldyhyde study/hitjob that rocked the vape world a few years back? Yeah, the cannabis side of things never got over that or even fully understood it. Also, the PG cut carts got a reputation for being generally shitty. Back in the day any jackass that wanted a blackmarket brand would dilute whatever shit oil he had w/ 1:1 or 2:1 or 3:1 pg to oil and sell \'em to dispos. High PG content is harsh and not super fun to vape, especially on shitty clearomizers. Then "the Clear" came out, the first guys selling distillate and this uncut high potency oil came to be associated with potency and purity. \n\nIts a weird industry man. People switched to MCT because \'hurr durr it\'s coconuts, they\'re natural! better than that antifreeze pg\' and you can try to argue and try to educate but your average purchasing manager at a dispensary is stoned off their ass and doesn\'t give a shit. \n\nI\'ve seen the same thing for years on the extraction side of things. The number of people that claim to love on Co2 extraction because it\'s "solvent free" blows my mind. CO2 IS THE SOLVENT (not to mention that it has to be post processed by dissolving it in ethanol, another solvent, and filtered)  Solvent by itself doesn\'t mean bad or good, just a substance that dissolves a solute, to form a solution. Butane extraction is great, cost effective, and makes a killer product. We just make extra sure we get it all back out, lab test down to the parts per billion, and it makes a better product twice as fast for half the money. But oh god no it\'s made with a solvent!

I\'m very underinformed when it comes to pot and how it overlaps with vaping. I only recently realized people were vaping pot outside of just using regular wax in those wax burning vapes. \n\nHonestly, I\'m sort of hoping that some informed regulation works its way into the scene. It sounds like it would benefit people like yourself, and it would be a hindrance to the shady "cart-dealers". I don\'t even smoke pot and I\'ve been pretty nervous about vaping lately, even though I\'ve been doing it for nearly 7 years now.\n\nI hope we have more people like you to help shape whatever regulations end up coming from this!', 'Hey OP! Thanks for the post. I own a vape business and have been very concerned with what has been going down and have been trying to educate myself. I have friends in the legal market and have been doing research to enter that industry (we are a large hardware distro, so we are looking at hardware.) Have a couple questions for you. \n\n1. Are thickeners and thinners regulated by state level control boards? Is it possible that the addition of vitamin E Acetate was overlooked when crafting product standards? I ask this question because there was a report out of Oregon where a patient claimed he bought a cart from a legit source. In addition, Mr Extraction claimed that he presented vitamin E Acetate as a candidate for an additive, and he made it sound as if OLCC had no idea what he was talking about. \n\n2. Have you seen any research indicating safe usage of vitamin e Acetate in an inhalation device? There’s another company out there Constance Therapeutics that claimed to have patented Vitamin E for use in their formulation, but have posted irrelevant research to support their position. \n\n3. Switching gears to hardware. What do you think is lacking on the hardware side for THC that you see on the vape side? Someone mentioned TC, and we’ve been working under a hypothesis that TC will have application for the cannabis markets (to account for terpene profiles as well as viscosity issues.) I’ve also been thinking about other features including dosing, product validation, and so on that I would want to include in my hardware design. What things do you guys consider when it comes to hardware? \n\nCheers!', '1. I can\'t speak for every state, but here in CA, not really. We are required to list ingredients and pass our Cat3 tests but aside from a list of things I can\'t use, there is nothing stopping me from using say...vegetable oil in a vape, aside from the fact that it would be an awful idea. \n\n2. There seems to be some indications that it is in fact safe. Or that at least certain isomers are beneficial. https://www.atsjournals.org/doi/full/10.1164/rccm.201303-0503ED\nOf course, what is actually being used on the market, and what is being used in a peer reviewed research study are different matters entirely. \nAlso, a certain % of the population seems to have some sort of allergic reaction to the vit e acetate, in the form of contact dermatitis. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20487657\nIt\'s possible that we\'re seeing cases in persons allergic to the substance, if indeed that is what this is, though the apparent lipidosis of presenting patients suggests it\'s more in the way of a lipid contamination of the product being used. \n\n3. Seeing some cool stuff come out on this front. I posted a reply to someone else mentioning that we\'re still in the stone age on the THC side, and that we don\'t even have temp control. I was (rightfully) called out on that was as there ARE temp control devices such as the pax era. I clarified by saying the vast majority of products being sold are not temp control nor do they have that capability. Most of whats on the market is standard 510 carts and disposables, and maybe devices have a preheat or power settings, but most are on/off button batteries. \n\nWe\'re in talks with a company bringing some pretty cool temp and wattage control devices out, I can\'t say specifics due to an NDA but there are cool things coming to the industry that are seeking to change the lack of control in hardware. \n\nI will say that I would like to the same temp control compatible coils brought to widespread use in the cannabis side. there\'s no reason to have devices get as hot as they do. Particularly with terpenes the amount of flavor preservation you get with low temperature hits is significant. Being able to precisely control the temperature of your coil would go a long way to preserving the integrity of the oil in your cartridge throughout it\'s life, as well as making sure that the flavor you\'re getting is what it\'s supposed to be. I think it would also reduce returns for "burnt" Cartridges. Something I\'ve noticed is that cannabis cartridged users tend to not understand wicking, or the need to give the thick viscous oil time to re-wick between rips.', 'Thanks for the read. Pretty interesting even for a European. You can get thc vape carts on the black market here. Was offered them more then once but always declined... thank you very much for the insight!', 'I vape both nic (in traditional, VG/PG juice) and dry herb cannabis (with a Mighty vaporiser) so I’m obviously not dealing with any liquid with the dry herb; could there still be any risk associated with vaporising cannabis ‘dry’? Or, in your opinion (which I value highly, as you seem to be an industry leader) is the risk entirely related to the terpene/thickener issues?', "Huge risks with vaping cannabis dry. Eating all of the doritos, finding cartoons funnier than they actually are, and forgetting where you left your damn keys have all been reported widely by users of the dry herb vapes. Be careful out there! \n\nIn all seriousness though, this seems isolated to vape carts. That said, make sure your herb is tested clean of pesticides, I've seen some nasty shit out there.", 'I\'m in the "nicotine vaping industry", just to be clear.\n\nI have a possible theory to explain some of the hospitalisation in the last few weeks. \n\nIn recent months we\'ve had a big rise in customers asking for peg400 (polyethylene glycol 400) to dilute extracts. (I\'m in belgium, where cannabis is illegal and "thc cartomizers" aren\'t readily available) \n\nOne of the side products of both pg and peg400 is DEG, which is extremely toxic to the human body, causing lung, liver and kidney failure. \n\n\nFrom what I understand, it\'s not very rare to see pg400 contaminated with DEG. \nAs where it is EXTREMELY rare to see pg contaminated with DEG. \n\n\n\nJust a possible cause, I\'m not a chemist nor am I an expert on thc cartridges,... \n\nFeel free to correct me if necessary!', 'So to be frank, I am not a fan pf PEG400. That said, people have been selling it as a wax "liquidizer" for...shit...six or seven years now? Not a new thing. THe original O-Pen Vape used only PEG400 (used to advertise how it was PG free!) \n\nMy gut feeling is that it\'s the thickeners.', "It sounds like you have a solid dispensary, though lab testing for contaminants wouldn't show anything they're not looking for. ie if they're using a thickener they know it's there so they're not testing for it, if that makes sense. That said, you're probably ok. I don't imagine that this is only isolated to the US, or why it would be. These products are available everywhere, though legit companies seem to not be using them (thankfully). \n\nHaha I have bottles of the uber thick they sent us to try. Never used it since they wouldn't tell me what it is. Going to send it off to an analytical lab to find out what it is. \n\nBlame is entirely on the individuals using products in their formulations that they are not aware of what comprises it, or its long terms safety for vape use. Small amount of blame (though I hate to victim shame) on the users that are buying untested black market products, though I understand being in a state with no other options. If you buy moonshine and it makes you go blind, well...it's not your fault it was contaminated and you do not deserve what happened, but you knew you weren't' buying a tested product from the liquor store and you were assuming some degree of risk.", 'vape carts are the hot dogs of the cannabis world.', 'good read thank you.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nis there a pinned thread that lists all of the black market vapes, carts, etc??? that would help immensely.', 'Well, they figure it out eventually. But testing FOR the presence of something against known reference samples, looking for identifiable peaks on your GCMS, is far cheaper and/or easier than trying to identify just what a mystery substance is when you have far less of a lead to go on. It can take a long time, and it can be very expensive. You need to find a specialty lab, and be willing to fork over several thousand dollars at a minimum. See here for the chronicle of individuals doing just that: https://www.icmag.com/ic/showthread.php?t=359328\n\nI\'m not saying that figuring out what is in these compounds is not doable, but that irresponsible individuals just don\'t care. "this company sells it, they say it\'s safe, and it works as far as dilluting my product, good!" instead of "hmmm what is this? This works as a dillutant, neat, but is it safe to vape? Ok now I need to spend several grand chasing down it\'s chemical constituents. Are those safe? Are there tests? Is it consistent batch to batch? What contaminants could be in future batches, like methanol contamination in alcohol, that could present a risk even if compound x is ok? What risks do those compounds pose?" \nThat level of R&D and Due Diligence is pricey. It\'s time consuming. It\'s difficult. You hit lots of dead-ends. Your average BM Cart slinger doesn\'t care.', "The chances of any tested products from a legit licensed facility is very very low. Particularly now, when the cause has become apparent and the story has gained such traction. I would be shocked if dispensaries weren't frantically evaluating products to limit liability. I know almost every client we manufacture for has checked, for the 20th time, that we don't use vit e acetate in any form for any sort of vape product. \n\nKeep in mind Vit E oil is not necessarily bad, you just don't want to vape it. We use it in topical skin creams as a natural preservative. It's super good for you! Just like...don't inhale a lotion.", 'lmao, all this negative stuff I just assumed was going to be the case with vaping. whats wrong with a bong or joint? weird kids out there man...\n\nAnything that comes from a tobacco company is almost 100% for sure going to be evil / health damaging\n\nsurprised pikachu that these vendors werent out for the public health angle!', "Cartridges are popular because they're portable, discrete, and convenient. Bongs are hard to use on the go, leave stinky smoke, and requires inhaling burning cannabis. Joints are portable, but again, they smell and require inhaling burning plant matter. Vaping, even portable vaporizers are great from the health angle, but you have to carry flower around with you which smells. If you're looking for a discrete solution, say you want to medicate before work or on lunch break, or even just like the ease and convenience of a cartridge, they're a great solution. If you're slamming bongloads in your car before work you probably will be needing to dust off your resume soon. \n\nThere are many reputable companies that make fantastic products. I know all the brands we manufacture for use top tier ingredients. The problem with this situation, as I laid out in my post, is the lack of any of these controls in the black market. Not sure what you got from my post that alleges this has anything to do with tobacco companies, though I agree that they tend to be soulless bastards.", '>Shame that it had to hurt vaping in the process.\n\nOr shame that 5 people fucking died along the way , maybe?', 'It is an absolute travesty, and my heart goes out to all of the victims. Even those that did not die are going to suffer life-long health complications as a result of this issue. I hope I did not come across as cavalier or uncaring about the victims, that was not my intention. I was hoping to educate people about whats going on, to the full extent I could based off of my professional experience. I truly and deeply feel awful for those that have lost their lives, or their health, and for the families that are left behind feeling loss and grief at their loved ones being so unfairly taken away by greedy or ignorant individuals selling adulterated products to make a quick buck. \n\nThat said, it is an absolute shame this is being used to further the unwarranted and dangerous attack on electronic nicotine vaporizing devices and the surrounding industry. Millions of people have given up smoking using e-cigarettes, and restricting or banning access to these types of alternatives will result in people going back to smoking or turning to an underground market (ironically the source off the issue in the first place) which will result in greater harm and suffering.', "No sadly, we did this ourselves. Not to say that the bastards at Big tobacco aren't very happy to encourage and shift the blame towards the ecig industry.", 'Certain people in the unregulated black market figured out how to sell vape carts with less thc in them that look like they have more thc in them by cutting them with a type of oil. Oil in the lungs is bad. People breathing the oil got sick.', 'I wanted to say thank you for your honesty and integrity.  I have been vaping for about 12yrs now of and on.  I used to smoke before that, but never hard-core (pack a week or so, and mainly just when stressed).  Vaping allowed me to have that nicotine relaxation and not smell like someone dumped an ash tray over my head.\n\nI like your theory on the pneumonia.  It goes hand-in-hand with my experiences with vaping with the larger tanks and sub-ohm coils with WAY better clouds than we got years ago.  The flavors are also MUCH better and more diverse than we had when I first started.  The thing I started seeing in myself was that my asthma was MUCH worse during allergy season.  I had minor asthma when I was a kid ( I played soccer for over 11yrs playing midfield and goalie), but it was never very bad.  After getting caught up in the "BIG Cloud Craze" a few years ago, I have noticed that I can\'t handle the PG.  Taking a hit off of a 80/20 (VG/PG) flavor causes me to cough and tightness in my chest for a couple hours.  Nothing a breath-taking cough, but that irritated limp-rag cough that just makes you feel like a wimp.  Moving to 85/15 mix solves the cough issue and I can vape normally again.  I went to a Blue Man concert last year, and literally thought I was going to die right there on the floor.  Fog machines were never really a big issue...but DAYUM...I literally sat on the floor wheezing curled up in a ball wondering if I could get the breath to ask my wife to call 911 to get me out of there in the middle of the show.  Call me stupid, but I coughed and wheezed the rest of the way through that $120 per person show, and almost crawled outside to hack and cough and try to breathe on the monorail.\n\nThat experimentation got me thinking about PG in vapes.  Then "all" of the deaths hitting mainstream and the Blame Game starting up for vapes in general.  If you add the fact that Vaping creates "water" vapor, it stands to reason that "water" will stand in your lungs until dissolved.  That liquid standing in your lungs is typically how pneumonia is identified.  Now that we have the pneumonia link, then you add in the asthma portion of this.  If you are suffering an asthma attack, you will have increased shortness of breath (which is already decreased due to the liquid in your lungs).  Both asthma and pneumonia kill people regularly, but not  a lot of Press on it anymore because it is so common.\n\nNow you add in the barely (if at all in some states) regulated THC/CBD pods that will help you to relax, then you have a true formula to kill people.  Think about it...you are having trouble breathing and your panic sets in...what do you reach for when you are panicking?  Your handy vape with CBD inside to relax, right?  Kinda scary, if you ask me...', 'Just a heads up, tagging a user in a post does not send them a notification.

I know I won’t pick one up again but this is scary shit Hahahaha', 'Apologies for the delay getting back to you. I was out and about yesterday and your question took a minute to lay out. \n\n>Could you go into a little detail about how the (Cali) market is currently regulated from a quality control standpoint?\n\nEveryone has to abide by the CDPH and BCC regulations regarding cannabis processing, production, and distribution. This includes Cat. 3 Testing which currently includes total cannabinoids, Pesticides, heavy metals, toxins, microbials, foreign material, water activity, etc... I\'m sure vitamin e is going to be banned for use very soon now. \n\n\n>At least in the pharmaceutical industry, there are very strict standards such as cGMP or Current Good Manufacturing Practice guidelines enforced by the FDA. CGMPs provide for systems that assure proper design, monitoring, and control of manufacturing processes and facilities.\n\nCurrently not a thing we\'re required to abide by right now. Municipal codes tend to dictate (at least for us) how the facility is built out, which can vary wildly depending on your locale. The CDPH does audits and has a wide amount of discretion on things they can decide to enforce.\n\nFunny enough this was another one of my topics I covered in my presentation. CGMP and FDA regulations. I covered the fact that it\'s a matter of time before they become the rule rather than the exception in the cannabis industry and the smart boys and girls out there would be preparing now rather than scrambling later. We made the investment upfront when we built our facilities and it will be a matter of going through the approval process rather than scrambling to get compliant. Somethings we are required to do by the regulations do mirror CGMP rules however, for example our batch records (both electronic and hardcopy backups) are very elaborate and cover everything you would expect to see in a CGMP facility. In our last audit they selected 4 random products in our distribution warehouse and without my help the auditor had to be able to "walk through" the entire production chain, to trace source materials back throughout the process. Fortunately (for us, not the trees) we go above and beyond what is required documentation-wise (again, prepare now for FDA and CGMP) and it was easy-breezy. \n\n\n>Is this being handled by a state agency in California or is it self-enforced?\n\nState agencies.\n\n>Also, while it\'s quoted that these cases of acute lung disease are from products purchased at unlicensed pop-up shops, you seem to imply that manufacturers (who are "legit" enough to be at an industry presentation) are using these specific isomers too. Could this suggest that these manufacturers are supplying the same products to licenced shops too?\n\nI have no way to know unfortunately, though I would be surprised if no one was using a thickener-type product. Certainly these same suppliers are selling to legal and illlegal operations alike. True Terpenes, Floraplex, etc... they sell thinners, thickeners, terpenes, and flavors. They don\'t check to see if you\'re licesnsed and they\'ll sell it in 10mL to 100 gallons. Again, the point of my talk(s) was \'don\'t use mystery shit if you don\'t know what it is and that it\'s safe and approved for the intended use\'. FWIW the only ingredients in vape carts/disposbles that have left MY facility are Cannabinoids, Terpenes and/or natural vape flavors. \nI know labs are bringing out tests for vit e acetate, and those should be online very soon. No dispo wants to be selling a product that is going to kill their customers and bring the heat down on them. \n\n>Anyways, your conclusion is the same as mine. There is a reason quality regulations exist, and they\'re to protect the consumer. Whether this trend will speed-up or slow-down the path towards federal legalization and the accompanying FDA regulations, time will tell. My hope is the former from a purely healthcare standpoint.\n\nAgreed 100%', 'My experience is I bought the CBD oil Vape pen cartridge 2 years ago and it was unvapable.

After a week of that, certain juices started making me nauseated (even 0 and 2 nic juices), and now, I can't even handle second hand vapor. It will literally make me throw up. it's kinda unfortunate for me when I walk into an establishment (esp restaurants) that allow vaping and there's a group of people blowing huge clouds.

Alaska: Alaska no longer considers E-cigs to be tobacco products (Lets hear it for Alaska!)|*|['> Making the ban more likely to pass is the combination of an offshore drilling ban with the public vaping ban, meaning that either both pass or neither will.

An open letter to Efest...you've gone too far.|*|["The vaping community has your back, Mooch. Keep doin' what yer doin'.", "I don't think this gets said often enough: Thank you for the tests you run, and for trying to keep the vaping community informed.

Further - I trust his results implicitly - just look at the data he provides!\n\nI've only ever bought an eFest Charger - but rest assured I will NEVER spend a dime on an eFest *anything*.  Further, I'll be sure to proselytize against them for their deceptive ways. \n\nThis could have gone very differently if they had apologized and promised to look into and address the issue. Instead they chose to treat the vaping public at large as a group of morons. For shame, eFest, for shame. \n\nOne other thing I'll add - I'm also a huge RC enthusiast - and I also won't be spending a dime on eFest equipment for that hobby anymore either. ", 'Mooch you most defiantly should not have to write this sort of letter. If not for people like you who care enough to make sure the batteries we use every day are safe there would be a lot less fingers in the vaping community. Thank you for doing what you do. \n\nThat being said I have a request. I have not found a single place where someone has posted a test for the batteries I purchased online. I found a review that said they were great batteries but nothing more. What I have are the Vappower 2000mah 35a batteries with a max 50a pulse. I got them from IMR batteries for 4 bucks a pair. Not a bad price. I have been using them in my parallel box mod with no issue but want to know exactly how safe they are. Thank you again.', 'Here is the email I just sent to admin@efestpower.com. I would love it if others would do the same and let them know that their behavior is directly costing them money.\n\n"Good evening,\n\nI am writing today to inform you that I will not purchase any Efest product ever again. I am a vaper and I will be buying your competitors\' products from now on. The reason for this is that your company consistently lies to its customers about battery ratings. Your company\'s recent attack on Reddit user Mooch315 was unprofessional and unreasonable. I am disappointed that your company has chosen to harm the vaping industry rather than be one of its leaders. \n\nPlease let me know if you have any questions for me.\n\nSincerely,\n\nNorm Steadman, former customer."', "Mooch,\n\nI am appalled that a company would so blatantly accuse someone of your caliber of lying or, worse yet, willfully misrepresenting your findings simply to boost your ego. This is uncalled for, and I will NEVER or recommend any eFest product again. \n\nThe work that you do to ensure that we, as a community, are working with products that are safe and reliable is so very much appreciated. The fact that you do this by your own volition is laudable. I'm not the brightest when it comes to electronics, but I know quality work when I see it. Thank you. For your work, for your persistence and above all your integrity. ", "Well mooch I agree with you totally, they shouldn't be badmouthing you to people over the internet. I see you as a small independent lab testing batteries for the community and not for profit, for the community's overall saftey and well being. The fact is I've never trusted efest batteries because they poped up specifically for vaping. I trust your tests more than all manufacturers because you have nothing to gain from the test results...\n\nIdk I've been pissed about them slandering you since I read that post by /u/Miataguy94 which was very eye opening about how they do business.\n\nI guess what I'm trying to say is keep doing what your doing I trust you a small independent tester more than a Chinese  corporation. Efest has never had any of my business but this whole situation has made sure they won't get any business from me in the future.", "/u/Mooch315\n\nI love you. \n\nFuck efest and everything they do. \n\nLove, \nThe vaping community. \n\n\nSeriously though. Your word is holy and screw those who say otherwise. Being an electronics nerd as I am, I can see how you test and understand your results and know you're not lying, nor do you have a reason to. I promptly threw out my original set of purple efest batteries because of an early review of yours. \n\nDon't let what they say disrupt your mindset. You're a pillar of this community, and are regarded as such. Screw them. \n\nVape on, dude. ", "I bought my mom a Subox Mini for her first vape. Over 3 decades of smoking and she's ready to give it up, how could I not? The vape store gave me an Efest, and as soon as I saw your posts, /u/Mooch315, I took the battery away from her and gave her my own.\n\nAs soon as the store opened, I returned the battery and the store didn't question me *once.* Heck, the clerk had a green smurf ready for me when I got to the counter. Reputable vape stores listen to their customers, and when a product is continually being returned, it won't take much for Efest to either get their shit together, or quit making batteries.\n\nFuck Efest", 'I bet lobbyists pay out companies like efest to purposely false advertise products that could be dangerous if used improperly so that threads like this become popular on the internet so that the fda can have a reason to ban vaping so that the big tobacco industry can prosper :/', "Keep fighting the good fight Mooch. Battery safety is very important to us as a community and your research has helped us realize just how desperate some companies are to make a buck or two (although with most of us being former smokers, you'd think we'd already know that lol). Thank you for the time and effort you go through to help all of us. ", 'A great deal of us who have used 18650s for a long time before we even started vaping would have always told you that using and efest was a bad idea(I put them on the same level as TrueFire :P). As always mooch id like to thank you but in particular in this instance for doing something missing in the so called modern "free market" system. People should educate themselves and help educate others while putting shitty companies in their place and out of business. Everyone should boycott and not buy batteries or any product from a company that is either incompetent, dishonest, or even both.', "I just wanted to reiterate to you /u/Mooch315 how awesome you have been with our community. Coming from a pretty noobish vaper, I can say that your work with batteries has truly helped me ensure that I am safely using my batteries and more importantly, that my batteries are the right ones. \n\nGlad my letter could help in any way possible. I didn't expect much from it, I honestly just sent the email as an angered customer but it is good that you can use it.", 'It wasn\'t their batteries that put them and all of their products onbmy "don\'t buy" list...

Congress and Big Tobacco Satire|*|["I think this is one of the reasons the media is quick to condemn vaping. Big Tobacco ran a huge scam on the whole country for years.

All the while the government did nothing and the media licked boot. There are books written about how completely in the dark Big Tobacco kept everyone despite mounting evidence to the contrary. \n\nThe government and media both want everyone to know they're totally reformed and would never do anything like that again (even though they both still do). So if you can take a couple of shots at the little guy while still bedding the giants of industry, it's an easy win.", 'I\'ve seen people, non-vaping friends, express the opinion that vaping is the "next thing" from Big Tobacco. \n\nIronically, this is partly to blame on anti-vaping ads that Big Tobacco themselves put out (that look like actual concerned citizen type adverts, instead of what they actually are).  The fuckers have zero morals. They\'ll even disparage themselves to get their anti-vaping propaganda out! To the the detriment of the public. \n\nEven the FDA is their puppet, let alone how congress is in bed with them, and their like. I suppose nobody is surprised at this anymore, but the lengths they go to... I keep being shocked by it. What is really sad is how effective such completely bogus propaganda can actually be, and MUCH more importantly, how many lives it costs. :(\n\nKeep the faith my friends.

/r/thathappened vaping story I found on Facebook|*|["Oh you didn't know police officers are given mod holsters now for their vapes? Haha", 'My bud got pulled over because someone saw him vaping at a light (or driving) and called and reported his plate number and that they saw him doing drugs while driving. Opposite of the other stories as he spent two hours cuffed and sitting on the curb as they searched his truck and questioned him. Oh yeah, the vaping stuff was not an issue with them but they thought he could be lying when he said he was just vaping so they asked if they could do a search and explained if he refused they would call a K9 unit. He said "Go ahead" as he had nothing to hide and figured the wait on the K9 would just be longer and look suspicious. So hours wasted on all parts due to nosey, uninformed, busy bodies. *sigh*', '510 vape it bruh', 'I actually had something similar happen to me, but it wasn\'t as epic. I was Vaping in a park which is on the property of an Adult learning center ( Used to be an elementary ) waiting to pick my friend up. Now I was about 50 meters from the playground. This Mom walks up to me screaming and raving about me Vaping in the park. Now I am a pretty lax person when it comes to moving away from people when vaping, and I made sure I was 50 meters from the fence for the playground. I explained this to her to which she replied that she was going to call the police, so I said go ahead. The police showed up about 10 minutes later, she starts screaming about what I am doing, and then all I did was pull out my mod he said and I quote " It\'s nice to see young people doing their best to quit" and pulls out a little pen out of his pocket and hits it. He looked at her and told her to leave me alone. ', 'I sold some excess gear to a Sheriff deputy acquaintance not long ago who gets his morning coffee in the same shop I do. Showed him how to rebuild Nautilus coils. First person I saw vaping a mech mod when I got back from overseas was a Chicago cop outside the airport.', 'Actually something very similar happened to my mother. As me and my mom were outside Walmart (my mom had just started to let me vape) my mom pulled out her vape and began to use it when what she would normally do is smoke a cigarette. I am 18 at the time, but I look super young. All of a sudden, this maniac super bitch comes out and purposefully walks into my mother cloud (which is SUPER small seeing how it is an istick 20W with a nautilous mini) and begins to cough very loudly. She said "You shouldn\'t be smoking that nasty shit in front of your child!" She said "First of all, he is not a child. Second of all, this isn\'t a cigarette. It is helping me quit smoking and is completely harmless." So my mom keeps vaping anyways and tells her to fuck off. This is when the inner beast comes out of this woman. She starts getting a little red as she says "That.... Is.... So.... Rude!" Now keep in mind we are not cloud chasing out here. We are blowing tiny-ass puffs. But then, our knight in shining armer with a Sigelei (either Plus or 150W there was no way to tell) and his Darkhorse RDA plumes a cloud that was heavier than my fucking weight directly into her face and walked away. I never got the name of this hippy looking hero. But if you\'re reading this: thank you.

When they arrived, there was nothing they could do, of course, since I was well within my rights to shoot on my own property, but they have to come out to investigate anyway. The two responding officers ended up hanging out until they had another call, shooting our rifles and smoking a couple of cigs.

"vApINg iS mArKeTEd tO KiDs"|*|["In the end, vaping will be regulated, no questions about it. We will need to change our labels. The question is if it will be the government regulating the industry, or if it will be self-regulation. \n\nJust because liquor companies produce shit like this doesn't make it right by any means, you're right. \n\nVape companies need to get their shit together and create an overseeing body which creates reasonable limits for safety and design. If they don't, the government will and I guarantee you it will be much more expensive and difficult than necessary to produce juice.

PSA: This is how imminent these regulations are....|*|['I think the general public needs to realize that this battle is not one over safety, or just about big tobacco "swooping in" to the market. Look at it on a larger scale. Like it or not, eliminating the traditional tobacco industry would be damaging to the US economy. (Note: Don\'t consider this comment as being in support of regulation. Read the rest first.)\n\nThere\'s the obvious surface issue of a non locally- and federally-taxed product competing with [one of the top tax earners in the country.](http://dailycaller.com/2011/02/28/what-would-an-america-without-smokers-cost/) We are talking about a product that the government heavily relies on for revenue. Increasing tax levels have not made a significant difference in consumer habit; either. Also a "surface" issue is the consideration that traditional cigarettes are statistically a habitual loop; you will probably be a consumer for the remainder of your life. A product designed to break this cycle isn\'t good news for a government that relies on the stability of the tobacco consumerism as a primary revenue generator. Couple this with the fact that it is significantly easier for a politician to suggest tax increases on taboos, you have a pretty good recipe for revenue generation. \n\n**Dig deeper.** [The health care industry generated $133 billion revenue as a direct result of smoking-related illness between 2009-2012.](http://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics/fact_sheets/economics/econ_facts/) Electronic cigarettes jeopardize that revenue stream. The agriculture and logistics markets would invariably suffer, too.\n\n**At the end of the day, smokers die earlier. This costs less for the government, as well.**\n\n“Smokers actually save the government money, both by dying earlier and thus reduce social security payments, and, to a lesser extent, by dying of relatively cheap ailments like lung cancer, a fairly quick killer, rather than more expensive, lingering ailments.”\n\nWhat is a government to do at this point? They are scrambling to mitigate revenue loss, generated directly by tobacco. The possibilities are to either:\n\n* Tax the vaping industry at the same rate as cigarettes are taxed. The con in their eyes: this still doesn\'t solve the issue of vaping being a smoking cessation product. There is a long history of tobacco taxation that won\'t be fought, and tobacco has a high "consumer retention rate". \n\nSo, the next \'logical\' thing to do would be to:\n\n* Cripple the industry to protect tobacco-generated revenue and prevent any financial hardships that would follow suit.\n\n[The government has relied on tobacco taxation as a staple of its portfolio for more than 100 years] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revenue_Act_of_1862), so it\'s pretty clear to see what\'s going on here in my opinion. Sure, you can try to make the blow easier by hiding behind the veil of health concerns, and perhaps some of the lesser political puppets will take the bait. In the end, though, it seems pretty evident that the situation is about a flawed taxation system. When an innovative product comes along that saves lives and generate tens of thousands of small businesses around the country but threatens pulling the financial rug out from under an already economically-weak government, their solution will be to stomp out the disruptors. \n\nThere will have to be a compromise of some nature, unfortunately. The government has been heavily reliant on taxing a taboo that we are ultimately eliminating. They will either seek to regain lost revenue by taxing the vaping industry, or look to crush the industry as a whole to maintain status quo. \n\nMy two cents.\n\n**EDIT:** A lot of people have been tossing around solutions; here\'s what I think a feasible defense looks like. Considering the vaping industry is largely comprised of "small business", there is no single entity that has the cashflow to facilitate Washington lobbying. I think we can all agree that lobbying, coupled with a strong association and rock-solid scientific studies, is the quickest way to produce tangible results. \n\nThere are the likes of NJOY et al., but their agenda is different than the community agenda. A proposed discussion point is to have a single representative body carry out the hiring and management of top-tier industry lobbyists to give these guys hell for the next couple of years. Lobbying *could* buy time while the industry strengthens, and we should see some larger corporations of sizable valuation rise up and aid in combatting harsh regulation. Secondarily, third party scientific testing will need to be performed on the behalf of the vape community, which is not a cheap endeavor either. Thirdly, campaigns need to be created to combat the smear campaigns and misinformation being run against the industry. This combo seems to be one of the only ways real progress will be made.\n\nThe issue of funding is a big one, of course. [NJOY, for example, spent $340,000 last year in lobbying on the State.] (http://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/clientsum.php?id=F6953%20%20%20%20%20&year=2014) There will undoubtedly be the need for a good cash reserve in order to accomplish anything, and the industry is way too young to have corporate giants that will lead the pillage. I see this happening in a few different ways, ranked in order of efficacy:\n\n* **Community Donations.** If you want to fight, pony up. I\'m sorry to tell you, but an email to your Congressman won\'t be bringing any kind of change. Money fights money.\n\n* **Fundraising Campaigns.** You see these with all major associations; the vaping industry should be no different. A proper campaign will double as a great mass-market awareness tool.\n\n* **B&M and Online Shop-Solicited Donation Requests.** Self explanatory, customer opt-in.\n\n* **A Weekly or Monthly day where a portion of nationwide purchases goes to the campaign.** A sliver of all purchases made on said day will go towards the cause. Consider this, ironically, a tax of sorts. The difference is, it will be a selective participation event and it will be paid for on the shop-end. State bodies use this method in other scenarios very successfully. \n\n**No one else will fight for you; in life, in business, and in vaping.** Everyone has an agenda, and for a fight to be even remotely successful, this needs to be the adopted mentality. Money will continue to be the most effective way to fight money, as it historically has. The question is; how bad does the community want to preserve our industry?\n\nSorry for the hijack, /u/TropicalWalrus.', "You mention increasing tax levels not having an impact on consumer habits; I looked up the info a month or two ago for my country (Canada) to back up a point I was trying to make, and while the number of people smoking has been reduced by more than half since 1985, the amount of revenue has stayed steady, and in some years even surpassed what they brought in when there were more people smoking. \n\nSell 10 of something for $5, or 5 of something for $10, and you're making $50 either way. I admittedly don't know much about how it all works, but I'd say they're arguably making more money because selling less product would seem to mean less overhead to deal with while still bringing in the same amount at the end of the day. I could be entirely wrong about that, though.\n\nRegardless, everything you say is true.\n\n[Number of Canadian smokers](http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/hc-ps/tobac-tabac/research-recherche/stat/ctums-esutc_2012-eng.php)\n\n[Tax revenue, not including sales tax or goods and services tax](http://www.smoke-free.ca/pdf_1/totaltax.pdf)\n\nUnless I'm interpreting something incorrectly, this pretty much sums up the government's issue with vaping.", 'I hope you don\'t mind that I chime in.\n\nTo be candid in my introduction, I work with the News & Review based out of California, and have been working with /u/StefanDidak from SFATA, CASAA, and other vape-related organizations on some projects that you just listed. [Here\'s my background, and a brief introduction to the background of my company](http://norcal.sfata.org/2015/03/we-need-action/). Our clients include The Salvation Army, Citibank, and numerous health care organizations. You can find our website [here](http://www.nrpubs.com).\n\nLet me reiterate and add to some points that you\'ve made:\n\n> ...campaigns need to be created to combat the smear campaigns and misinformation being run against the industry. This combo seems to be one of the only ways real progress will be made.\n\nYes. If there\'s any proof that we can bring up as of late, we should look to the rising popularity of [notblowingsmoke.org](http://www.notblowingsmoke.org). Stefan has done a fantastic job (and in a very quick time frame) to give the general public the option of what they choose to read. What they choose to believe is a different story. \n\nI want to address efforts spent developing "counter-campaigns". They will only take you so far, especially if your opposition has the funds to flood the market with the information they want to spread. If you keep trying to fix leaks as they pop up rather than take preventative measures to make sure they don\'t occur, you\'re going to end up chasing more problems than you can handle. You also run the risk of drawing more attention to their efforts. \n\n> Community Donations. If you want to fight, pony up. I\'m sorry to tell you, but an email to your Congressman won\'t be bringing any kind of change. Money fights money.\n\nThose efforts still count - but you need to be aware of what your message conveys.\n\nI\'ll highlight this because I feel it\'s important to discuss:\n\n> *Money fights money.*\n\n**This is true, but you need to know how/where your money is spent**. We started working with Citibank on a financial literacy publication for their "Money Matters" program. This regional, ~$20,000 project - a blip on their $65 million dollar marketing budget - ended up being the most effective use of their marketing dollars for this program. They approached us after the first project\'s success, and then we adapted it for 16 regions with over 2 million circulation.\n\n> Fundraising Campaigns. You see these with all major associations; the vaping industry should be no different. A proper campaign will double as a great mass-market awareness tool.\n\nAround 2006-2007, certain government agencies threatened to shut down our Sacramento newspaper for allowing 420 advertisements to run. As a company run by individuals who marched during the civil rights movement, we chose not to back down and stand by our business partners.\n\nOne of my partners has been the marketing representative for most of our 420/Cannabis business partners for the past eight years. Five years ago, she started "Collective Giving" in an effort to get most of her dispensaries to raise funds for the community and raise awareness for good business practices. The results have been phenomenal. Two years ago, Collective Giving gathered nearly 4,000 pounds of canned goods for a local food bank. Their second fundraiser gathered $4,000 in cash donations for a community-based cancer peer navigation program with joint effort from the UC Davis Comprehensive Cancer Center. You can find more information about Collective Giving on their website [here](http://www.collective-giving.com/).\n\nAnyways - good post. I\'ll address more points later, and if anyone feels to the need to pick my brain or be involved with our project, give me a PM and I\'ll make sure to respond within the week.', 'Could this theory apply to a country with universal healthcare like Canada which is trying to do the same thing? It seems Health Canada has been pouring tons of money into anti-smoking laws and PSAs for years so you would think there would be more pro-electronic cigarette support especially since I would expect the tax dollars earned from tobacco sales go directly towards covering the extra costs incurred by the healthcare system.', 'All good points. But I would also stress that the sheer number of lives that vaping can save is an important player in this conflict. Today I imagine an article I would like to see: How Congress is threatening to shut down and Industry at the cost of thousands of lives. Or a 60 Minutes news segment that makes the same. In fact, we ought to write to 60 minutes', "> The health care industry generated $133 billion revenue as a direct result of smoking-related illness between 2009-2012. \n\nThat's $133 Billion that would've been spent elsewhere - significantly boosting the economy in other ways.

How about marijuana.", 'Ive said this before and Ill say it again. \n\nat this point, I do not even remotely care what the FDA thinks. I am going to vape even if it is banned outright. I smoked for 27 years heavily and have not smoked since picking up my first PV over 2 years ago. This is my body, my life, my lungs and my choice. I refuse to recognize their authority in this manner.', "That's pretty much how all my pot-smoking friends feel about pot being illegal.\n\nThey're gonna do it anyway, regardless.  Making something illegal only makes it more dangerous and costly, not actually eliminates it.", "As much as I agree with your sentiment wholeheartedly, we still need to do whatever we can to fight this from happening.  Why stand by and let this crippling regulation destroy something we all love??\n\nI've said this before and I'll say it again: This fight is NOT just about us - we will find a way to continue vaping - it's about the millions of people still smoking that won't be given the chance to better their lives and live healthier... THAT'S what this is about.", 'Good luck, I hope the police men do not break into your house and steal all your money and vaping products and take you to jail.', 'If every site that sold vape gear had a sopa style huge splash page with "THIS IS HAPPENING BEWARE HERES WHAT YOU CAN DO" style thing on it we might actually see some change.', "i've often wondered why this is not the case. vape businesses seem to be perfectly ok with getting shut down within a few months.", 'Hey y\'all, I really don\'t want to sound too "doom-y"/alarmist here, but [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/306flr/fda_delineates_how_deeming_regulation_would_ban/) needs to be paid attention to.  It was posted yesterday but I don\'t think it got nearly the attention it deserved...\n\nIn particular, the comment in the screencap really made my heart sink.  As disheartening as this is, we really need to let those words sink in, think about it, and then come together as a community to act.  We need to keep fighting and never give up.  We need to stay firm and not give in, not even an inch.\n\nYou\'ll notice that the parent comment mentions the push to change the grandfather date, but that \n\n> It needs to be something done in Congress as a law.\n\nThis could be our call to action - we need to start sending letters out to our Congressmen urging them to get off their lazy asses and actually do something about this, rather than just sending a letter to the FDA (which does nothing but certainly fools most of the public into thinking that they\'re at least trying)\n\n**Either way folks, the time to act is NOW.  This is extremely urgent, and we can\'t afford to lose any more time.  We all need to rally together NOW and stop them from taking away our rights.

If this does pass, what does it mean? No more e-cigs? Period?

I mean, I can go back to being fidgety and biting my nails but I would really prefer not to. Are these laws basically going to shut down the e-cig market?", "I posted the initial thread and want to thank you for continuing it in spirit with your advocacy.

Hopefully everyone is more mindful of the upcoming dangers that threaten not only us, but more importantly those who may never be given a fighting chance to quit smoking.\n\nWe are already a step ahead and a lot of us have had our foot through the door for a long time. We need to also fight for those whos lives are in danger. We all know vaping can save lives and we need to make sure it can continue to effectively do so. Its not just about us, its about every smoker.", "Two questions. \n\nFirst, how does this affect hardware? Vaping hardware isn't necessarily used for nicotine consumption, plenty of people vape 0mg. \n\nSecond, how does this affect liquid vendors? Couldn't they just switch to 0mg blends only and require those who want nicotine to buy it elsewhere and add it at home?\n\n", 'They\'re going to screw us either way.

We barely have smoking bans on traditional tobacco products.

Kasich is not a fan of vaping, in fact pretty anti in fact. Has a proposed 95% tax on ecig products right now and who knows if it will be passed in or not. Also career Republican Mike Dewine wants to see the FDA ban all eliquid flavors. These two men alone are powerful in political sway in Ohio, and they are not for the vapers.\n\nEdited: I have got a hold of Dewine a few times via email and phone call, let\'s just say after I had a few word for him, he said he will try within his power to do what ever he pleases based on his opinions and agenda. Lets just face it, none of these stooges are for their constituents and these damn "small government, protect the jobs" Republicans are just as big of shills as their democrat counterparts. At least the dems don\'t lie about it and try to claim they all about anti taxation and pro small business. If anything, that is far from the truth from my experience.', "Alabama here - we're fighting a ~40% tax on all eliquid right now that's been proposed.", '>Anyone in conservative and/or tobacco states care to \n\nIndiana here.

There was a radical bill that would not consider e-cigarettes to be tobacco but it's stuck in committee until FDA finalizes it's regulations.", "I'm confused about why you merely link to an image of a screenshot of a comment on reddit *instead* of a summary explanation about what's up. \n\nThe 'beginning of the end' sounds a bit dire. IMO there is no way to completely kill vaping. This is not flavored cigarettes. As long as PG/VG base with nicotine is sold then vaping cannot die. The worst that can happen is flavors are sold separately and you mix them together at home. Yes this would suck, and yes a lot of people/stores  would not be able to adapt their business model which would be sad. (maybe it would kill zamplebox though, a silver lining ;)  )\n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm not advocating ignoring this stuff because it will still live on in a different form. We deserve to continue as it is currently. I have only seen juice vendors (except for the few scammers, but they're far and few between) who care about their customers and post large blocks of text so that they can disclose info about what you're buying to the best of their knowledge.\n\nI bet if we go to the e-cig wiki article and look up edits, all of the ones that say that it isn't proven safer than cigarettes come from tobacco grower states, or IP address blocks associated with big tobacco. They have no morals, they know damn well that inhaling vegtable glycerin or even diacetyl loaded juices will never come close to the horrible dangers of tobacco. They sell death, and now they sell uncertainity in alternatives just so their business model (get people hooked, keep them hooked until they no longer breath, rinse, repeat) remains safe.\n\nI highly applause CVS for stopping selling cigarettes, you shouldn't be able to run a pharmacy if you sell products that are inherently dangerous.

This method benefits them while destroying the majority of the rest of the market. Also, cigalikes are much less likely to get someone to continue to stop smoking, everyone I know who didn't progress to something more than a cigalike/CE4 has gone back to smoking.\n\nAnd I'm not sure about the cigarette tax in the states but the vast majority of the price in the UK is tax. This is just my assumption but cigalikes have a potentially higher profit margin (to the company) per pack.", "They can keep selling us our nicotine fix via disposable cigalikes that don't really work and are gone after three hours and cost 3 times as much as a pack of cigarettes.", 'Yes and no.  Of the vapers I know, none have entirely quit nicotine.\n\nI started vaping 2.5 years ago and am still vaping 12mg.  I replaced cigarettes with something I view as less harmful.  \n\nI would eventually like to quit, but vaping gets me through the day and I just don\'t have the time or inclination to spend 2-4 weeks nic-fitting and being cranky.

Seems to me that all other types of inhaled, injected, or ingested products are regulated on some level why would ecigs and ejuice get to be excluded?  Any industry with the possibility of harming the user, and let's face it, ecigs although extraordinarily safe compared to regular tobacco products can cause harm through the nicotine in them.  What grounds do we have as vapers to denied the public the peace of mind of a FDA or whomever stamp of approval.  A truly unbiased, uninfluanced by lobbyists, comprehensive study on the issue would be hard to conduct but unless the government is aloud to do what they were designed to do, protect it's citizens from danger, this battle will continue.  The way I see it, without proper cooperation from ecig companies and vapers themselves, if there needs to be any, the governing body's will be forced into action by the people who line their pockets with mostly ungrounded rhetoric and will base their studies on big tabacco's data and their own, swaying their studies in favor or heavy regulation which will ruin the chances of small scale juice companies making it if government organization make it extrealmy difficult for them to become legal killing a new business sector pontecialy worth tens of billions of dollars over the few years.  I don't really know what my point is with anything after my initial question, I guess I just didn't want to sound like an uniformed idiot so I rambled about my prior knolege and for that I apologize but the question remains, what is the argument against regulation the vaping industry?", 'The argument isn\'t *against any regulation*, in fact I believe that most of the responsible vendors and vapers are in favor of regulation.  \n\nThe problem is creating **sensible** regulations.  Things like child-proof caps on eliquid, 18+ sales only are good for the industry to legitimize it.  However, the regulations as proposed by the FDA will essentially destroy the industry as we know it, effectively killing small businesses and competition.  \n\nIf these regulations go into place as-is, the "cig-a-like" closed systems will be the only products available to the market, and Big Tobacco will have been given a monopoly on the industry as they are the only companies that have the resources to comply with the multi-million dollar (per product) approval process.', 'No one objects to some regulation for public health and safety. That unfortunatley is not what these regulations address and what they do address is market share. The majority of the vaping industry is regulated out of business. ZERO. \n\nThis is not a doomsday scenario. Even the OMD Economic Impact Report projects the market of up to 500k products will be reduced to 25 and those that remain could require up to a million dollars each to stay. \n\nThe SBA wrote up a detailed letter on how damaging these regulation are and many of them violate fair business practices. \n\nFrom a public health perspective, there is little doubt that smoking rates would climb again. Among several large reviews, there has been no evidence that vaping is attractive to kids who don\'t smoke. If they were a "gateway" then smoking rates would have seen an increase as the addiction increased and instead it\'s been the opposite result; smoking rates, across all age groups, have never been lower. \n\nVapers are ex-smokers. There is no love of tobacco companies. We know they snuck in additives to make cigarettes more harmful and addictive. We don\'t want them to do that with vaping too. \n\nIt makes no rational sense to turn this industry over to the very same people that were responsible for the MSA to begin with. ', "Isn't boener a republican, or is that the joke? Both sides are being pretty gay about the whole vaping thing and I think they deserve to die and I hope they burn in hell!", "This isn't about accepting what the government wants to do to us and changing our lifestyle to fit that, this is about the fact that our personal freedoms are under attack and we shouldn't just lay down and let it happen without a fight.\n\nAlso, this fight is about the millions of Americans who are still smoking tobacco - if the vaping industry is killed, their best shot to potentially quit smoking will have been taken away.  Not only are they fucking us over, they're potentially sentencing all current smokers to death by eliminating the best tobacco harm reduction tool that has ever existed."]|*|["I think general public

I just like vaping and this subreddit has helped me out with various needs in a polite manner from beginner to now.  Maybe I\'m in the minority but I still feel like the world views the act of vaping as equal to smoking and I act as if that is true (I mean, it\'s not something to be proud of, it\'s a health risk that we happen to enjoy- if you make vape gear that\'s a little different, that\'s a DIY hobbyist who likes to work with their hands as well as enjoys vaping).  If someone asks me about my gear, it\'s like when someone used to ask me about my cigarettes and my rolling techniques- I fill them in, if they ask for help I give it.  Beyond that I never make comments about peoples setups- negative or positive because my perspective has always been "Get the gear you can afford and get the gear that suits your preference".  That\'s because you\'re right, there is nothing to be proud of when it comes to a vape setup besides maybe the disposable income that allowed you to buy it and maybe if you made a DIY mod by hand- even then, it\'s vain to brag about those things and really immature to put others down for not meeting your standards.\n\nI know you probably don\'t care, just thought I\'d let you know some of us out here feel the same way you do but are sticking with vaping for the sole reason that we like to vape- regardless of the community.

Its not the vaping industry's fault that they end in physical altercation. Spending 300$ dollars on a tube of metal can be looked at as crazy, but so can spending 5k on a watch or 100k on a car. People pay for what they want, quality, craftsmanship and to support someone with an original idea. its not your job to judge them for spending what they want on any item they want. its their money and their choice. The only thing i will agree with you on is that it kind of sucks when people expect free things and get upset when they dont get anything for free. personally, i always give free samples at expos but ive seen enthusiasts get genuinely upset when they didn't get something for free from another vendor.

This community is full of shitheads and douche bags, and you\'re most likely one of them. I know I was. The amount of bragging and overall fuckery in this community is worse than a damn college frat. No one cares how low your build is. No one cares how big your cloud is. No one cares how expensive your rig is. You spent 300 dollars on a metal fucking tube so you can stroke your dick about how far you can chuck your cloud. Congratulations. Too bad you can\'t put that on a resume. I\'ve never met a bigger collection of self entitled morons and conventions are the worst of all. There isn\'t even a game to it anymore. It\'s just walk up to a vendor and say "what can I have for free?" and when someone tells you no, you give them a bad review. Fuck you if you do that. You\'re an entitled shithead and no better than a god damn toddler. People have to work for a living. I know this is a strange concept for a lot of you, but that\'s how the world works.\n\nI started vaping as an alt to cigarettes. \n\nIt turned into a hobby. I like the thought of cloud chasing and I enjoy spending money on my hobbies. I can\'t put my 18-19 years of gaming on a resume either, and can barely justify the literal THOUSANDS I\'ve spent on gaming if I can\'t justify the few hundreds I\'ve spent on vaping. As with any hobby, there are the self-entitled folks who only think of themselves. I haven\'t met anyone, personally, who actually gives poor reviews for the lack of free things. I won\'t deny they exist, though, and I agree... fuck you if you do that.\n\n> I see these kids day in and day out. They work minimum wage at Dominos and vaping is their whole life. They think they can just start a juice company and be lazy fucks their whole life. It\'s so fucking pathetic. No drive, no ambition, no college, no tech school, no desire to do anything besides post that next insta video so they can get sponsored. Which brings me to my next point, sponsorships and cloud comps. I watched this community change from friendly cloud comps where the winner gets a bottle of juice to cutthroat competitions where the winner gets 10k, yes literally 10k, I\'m not being hyperbolic, and the competition ends in physical altercations and actual resentment between groups of people. Over a fucking cloud comp.\n\nThose kids exist in any hobby and will be existent until the lazy is called out. Wanting to start a juice company is cool, and how things start happening. Also, about the comps... I haven\'t been in the scene for more than 4 or 5 months, and I most certainly haven\'t been to a single comp that didn\'t take place between me and my friend at his place, winner getting free pizza dinner. I do agree, 10k is a bit overboard for a hobby that involves breathing something in and exhaling. There is no argument that, that\'s just dumb. However, you could almost compare the hobby comps to that of car audio comps. It costs a good bit of money to get in, and the rewards need to match. 10k is still overboard.\n\n> Shops, vendors, machinists, everyone in the community who is a part of this "sponsorship" only perpetuates this mentality. I get it though. It\'s cheap advertising. It\'s playing on the stupidity of this community to push your own product. I can\'t count the number of companies who make shit or overpriced products but are insanely popular because they got what\'s-his-dick (or what\'s-her-dick) to post an insta video for them. The worst part about it though? The people in this community are too stupid to look at a product objectively and make their own decision about it.\n\nI agree there is a lot of this going around. Personally, I see even one person praise a company, just on this sub, and I go to their site and compare prices. If their prices are fair, I try \'em out. This labor day I purchased nearly 500ml of juice from several different places. We\'ll see where it goes. I have no argument on this. People really need to figure out what is good for themselves. \n\n> You want to government to take you seriously? You want to avoid regulation? You want to "save vaping." So stop acting like a bunch of god damn children and clean up your act. This community has a victim-complex as bad as SJW\'s on tumblr. No one takes you seriously because of your own actions. It\'s not a great conspiracy to end vaping, it\'s much simpler than that. Vaping is taking money away from a great deal of industries and it\'s easy to attack this market because it consists almost entirely of morons and fools.\n\nI personally hate reading this one, you\'re just being cynical here. It doesn\'t matter the reason for vaping, the reason to chase better juice and mods, the need for higher/lower nicotine levels. If you\'re a vapor, you want vaping to succeed. The government is stopping this in *some* areas around the US (I\'ll leave other political issues for those who know more). In my own area, PA Governor Wolfe wants to add a 40% tax to all vaping gear and supplies. In other areas, the taxes are being put out and regulations are hitting hard. I forget where, but there is already an area where B&M stores are close to needing to move/close because of the regulations of the juice makers needing licenses and security. I wouldn\'t say the majority of this community is running on a victim-complex. We\'re defending something we enjoy, love, and do. We aren\'t getting into moral battles with anyone. However, this is for anyone else.... never fight a moral battle over vaping. If someone disses the vaping scene, so be it. \n\nThat\'s all I got. I\'m not arguing or debating you exactly, just adding into the conversation with what I see and believe. \n\nI\'m sorry you wound up feeling this way.', '>The people in this community are too stupid to look at a product objectively and make their own decision about it.\n\nThis is my biggest problem.

Something being LESS of a risk is good, but unless you know HOW MUCH LESS, it\'s difficult to call it SAFE. Everyday, I recommend vaping less and less because of the e-juice landscape.

If you think this hateful, deliberately inflammatory, and rage-filled post is "adding to the discussion" then, let me put this in no uncertain terms, you\'re a fucking idiot. \n\nNothing frustrates me more than listening to some self-entitled narcissist on the internet tell me what I am or am not. And to make matters worse, you don\'t even have the balls to do it on your main account. Way to go, what a hero you are, writing an angry post on the internet for a bunch of strangers to tell them how terrible they are. And by the way, "DOWNVOTE AND BAN ME YOU ASSHOLES" has no meaning when you\'re on a throwaway.\n\nIn case you haven\'t noticed, until otherwise proven, this shit is **saving lives.** For easily half the people who have ever even tried a vaporizer, this is was the **only** way they could quit smoking. If you had half a brain, maybe you\'d be able to see through all the smoke you\'re blowing to understand that. \n\nFor those of us who *aren\'t* smokers, it isn\'t "all about clouds" or "stroking eachother\'s dicks." Here\'s a hint, I don\'t even have a dick! I own an IPV4 and use a Mutilator RDA on TC mode. I like trying new flavors and meeting new people. I\'ve met a whopping **two** vaping assholes in my entire life--and that\'s with frequenting 6+ local vape shops. I have, however, met enumerable people who have had vaping change their lives in a positive way and are all about bettering the lives of others and spreading the love. These are people who are passionate about their hobbies, the protection of vaping, and about improving the lives of others. \n\nBut you know what? Here\'s the kicker. If I did want to buy the newest 500w-TC-LED-Backlight-Motherfucking-Tit-Chucking-Mod... It\'s none of your goddamn business and I reserve the right to do that. Like all hobbies, there are passionate enthusiasts and collectors and they deserve the right to show off just as much as an antique collector, car collector, baseball card collector, or computer geek. You\'re not morally obligated to like it or to partake in it, but you definitely need to step off the high horse that leads you to believe that the only *right* way to enjoy this hobby is *your* way. \n\nBut when it\'s all said and done, at the end of the day... I\'ve got terrible news for you, you self-entitled prick: \n\n#No one gives a shit about you leaving. \n\n^^Don\'t ^^let ^^the ^^door ^^hit ^^your ^^ass ^^on ^^the ^^way ^^out.

", 'Obviously it doesn\'t apply to everyone, but in general the vape community is one of the worst I\'ve ever been a part of. Ego, ignorance, and gullibility runs rampant.

Funny that one of those times happens to be right after you post this.\n\nI would say this subreddit is one of the better facets of the vape community (or was when I used to frequent it), but I still saw plenty of ignorant and/or flat out dangerous advice, and plenty of resistance to criticism. Hell, how many first time vapers got stuck with shitty iSticks because everyone here gets absurdly hyped about whatever is new that month? That\'s really stupid, potentially dangerous, and just plain shitty to the people asking for advice. A first time vaper should never be told to buy an unproven device.\n\nI\'m sure there are plenty of intelligent vapers, but it sure seems like most of the community is absurdly stupid, short-sighted, and conceited. I wouldn\'t refer to my self as a "vaper" at this point. I\'m a guy who vapes, but I don\'t want to be associated with much of the vaping community.\n\nDoes anyone else remember [this guy](https://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/2lw2gh/psa_dont_use_lead_instead_of_coil)?

I agree, the "friendly" part of a friendly competition has disappeared. \n\nThe unfortunate part is that this individual generalized a whole community. This also presents that stigma we all know pertains to a select few who give the community a bad image. All we want to do is start living a healthier lifestyle.', 'You\'re right, but you\'re coming off like you\'re an "ass-clown" in all walks of life, instead of just when it comes to vaping. A lot of us hold high end careers, have families, travel the world, etc...this community has gone downhill since when I joined 3 years ago, but it\'s no reason to hate the full extent of the vaping community. \n\nAll in all -- I don\'t associate myself with the vaping community, but I do enjoy chatting with friends about it. It\'s a chance to geek out about something outside of work, for me. I work in the tech industry, so everything I used to geek out over has become monotonous. Outside of a raspberry pi/adruino or a woodworking project here and there, vaping is one of the few hobbies I have where I\'m building ( or dialing in something) that my friends also share. It\'s kind of cool in that way. \n\nBut again, yeah...I don\'t get the vaping competitions or the self entitlement thing', "I like to post onto reddit when i build a new coil, but not because i like the fact that i can [chuck titties](http://i.imgur.com/aIuiWca.jpg) but because i'm kinda new to rebuilding, and look for advice from more experienced people...\n\n\ni understand the sentiment, though...there are some douchey vapers out there, and I just don't understand how people become so self-involved in their ability to BLOW VAPOR INTO THE AIR GODDAMNIT YOU PEOPLE ARE SO DAMN STUPID", 'It\'s posts like these that make me happy to live in a place (Vancouver, BC) where vaping is treated like smoking. You don\'t really see people "chucking tits" in public very often and definitely not indoors (aside from shops - which is technically not allowed but most shop owners I know allow it). I understand your frustration but your outlook is incredibly childish. \n\nVaping is still a fantastic alternative to smoking and I feel blessed to have successfully quit along with my girlfriend and a few other friends. \n\nPeople will always take everything to the n\'th degree, I play a lot of soccer and if I quit just because of all the Ital-douchebags in my league I would be giving in the same as yours, I\'m just proud not to be one. \n\nGood riddance to you, sir.', 'I swear, I miss all the drama. Earlier this week I had to say "Wtf?" to someone denouncing all the "vitriol spewing drama whores" on Tumblr. I\'ve been on there for years and all I get are neuroscience articles, medicine articles, comments on therapy methods, stuff on reading x-rays correctly, announcements of my favourite games and lots of art. The closest I\'ve come to drama was un-following a self proclaimed comedian after one too many off coloured jokes. Now this. \n\nI\'m afraid I am the enthusiast you speak off dear OP in that my rig cost 200$ and I am not here to stop smoking. I vape almost exclusively 0mg. Other than that though I don\'t even know the big name juice brands. I have never watched a video of someone vaping. My only experience with large impressive clouds was from one of the shops I frequent where some videos were running on a screen behind the till. There was a vaping convention I wanted to visit, but I wasn\'t well enough on the day. Most shop assistants I\'ve spoken to, have highlighted their love for the community and the people they meet as the most enjoyable aspect of their job. I definitely love trying all the juices at the bar and chatting with the other patrons. Then I make my purchase and go on my merry way. Like they do. \n\nI think you are being unfair on the minimum wage slave with no ambition. Some people aren\'t suited for intellectual work. It used to be that most people would be employed as manual labour with minimal training. Times have changed, but that doesn\'t mean people have. Worse, currently you are being told to be happy you have a job at all, even if the entire world looks down on you for "only" being dominoes minimal wage. These people still want to be good at something, want to be respected and taken seriously. They are very unlikely to get there via their main job, so they stick everything into their hobby. They can make 15k that way? Good for them! May be that can PAY for that education you are tooting so highly! They can get sponsorship? This is no longer a hobby, this is a way out of that minimal wage job! This IS their ambition! Yeah, that means less relaxed atmosphere for us hobby vapers, but may be we should count out blessings that we don\'t have to run for that win as an exit ticket from the life we hate. May be we should accept that by doing well, vaping has become big business. The same has happened to countless other hobbies and those hobbies are still alive and well. They had to adapt. Vaping is still new, it will have to adapt a lot. Cigarette smoke used to be blown up people\'s butts as a medical procedure. I\'m sure vaping will survive sponsorship. \n\nCrap, now I have wasted my life right back. \n\nTL;DR: You are an unpleasant and very entitled person. This has happened to a hundred hobbies before vaping and they are still fine. Also, your experience =/= everyone\'s. So stop spewing vitriol. ', "Ha ha ha ha Bravo my friend.

Sounds ridiculous, most of these kids at these shops are chumps. Do people consider smoking cigarettes a hobby it's more like an addiction. My girlfriend used to work at a shop as well and I can tell you that most people that hang out at these shops think vaping makes them look so cool and another thing they weird me out by how much they're into vaping. Seriously you have nothing better to do but chill in a vape shop for hours. I hope you guys understand that the people in the shops are not your friends they see you as dollar signs.

Guess what if you don\'t have a ton of fucking swag at your both at a convention or a celebrity exactly 0 fucks can be given about you. Look at music.

Ditch & Save - Because we don't care what our bottles look like. Info in the Comments|*|["It's not a bad idea... But the whole ban is bogus.  I smoked in high school, well before vaping was a thing.  A lot of people did.  They also dipped and chewed.  Kids will do stuff they're not supposed to do.  Banning vaping in any form isn't going to change that.", 'Went half an hour out of my way to my old shop in RI (right on the line) today because the shop near me in MA is closed.\n\nRI is facing a flavor ban next week.  The person working informed me that flavored Vapes make up 80% of their business.  And I know they are serious about carding, I\'ve been there many times and hung out for hours on end.  The owner is active in local politics and has been insanely diligent in keeping things on the up-and-up at her shop since opening 5 years ago.\n\nIn proposing the ban, the governor of RI stated that "adults don\'t drink chocolate and strawberry milk" (paraphrasing)...which is patently absurd on its own, but the states official bevarage is coffee milk.  For those that don\'t know, it\'s basically chocolate milk but with coffee flavored syrup instead of chocolate.', 'Same in Finland. And they banned flavors too. I had to quit vapeing then and went back to gross cigs for a while. Moved to the states and now they wanna take em away again... Fml', "When I was smoking pipe tobacco the tins followed that same packaging. Most was just plain lettering of the maker/blend and a nicotine warning, but a few times there were some pictures of a smoker's lungs or a smoker's heart.", 'Why is the vaping community so determined to design their graphics appallingly?', "Actually you are wrong. Having no regulation or whatsoever in vaping in the US brought you this ban. So it's FREE FREE FREE till it's BANNED BANNED BANNED. USA, where only extremes live.", 'If you go to the [Flavor Apprentice\'s website\'s spec sheet list](https://shop.perfumersapprentice.com/specsheetlist.aspx), you can see the list of aroma compounds along with their CAS numbers by clicking on their "List" link.\n\nThis includes their tobacco flavors. For example, here is their spec sheet for the DK Tobacco flavor.\n\nhttps://shop.perfumersapprentice.com/componentlist.aspx?sku_search=344218\n\nThe listed ingredients are;\n\nEthyl Alcohol\n\nMalic Acid\n\nCyclotene\n\nPyridine <2-acetyl->\n\nVanillin\n\nTetramethyl Pyrazine\n\nEthyl Maltol\n\n2-Methyl Butyric Acid\n\nEthyl acetate\n\n2,3,5 Trimethyl Pyrazine\n\nRhodinol\n\nAcetyl Pyrazine\n\nBeta Damascone\n\nYou can then use each of those compound\'s CAS numbers on the spec sheet page to find out which other flavors they are used in. Obviously, Vanillin and Ethyl Maltol are two of the most widely used compounds and are predominantly found in dessert flavors.\n\nSo I have no issue with what [Greg Conley is suggesting](https://old.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/d9kzbq/well_thats_that_from_gregory_conley/) in that all ejuices can now be simply renamed as a Tobacco Blend or perhaps just "Blend". Flavors are subjective, and the aromas are artificial. And judging by many of the comments in that post, most of you seem to actually agree that the labeling and naming of the products is irrelevant. We care about the flavors, not the labeling.\n\nIf you agree, please share the above image on facebook and twitter, and maybe we can get the **#ditch&save** trending.\n\nNo need to credit me also. Its the idea that matters.\n\n**#ditch&save**', "And get them out of gas stations. This is one of the most important advertisement spots for targeting kids (once cigarette companies were banned from regular advertisements this is what they pushed for). It's no coincidence that kids use almost exclusively the stuff bought at gas stations.", 'It wouldn\'t be unreasonable, but at the same time it is unacceptable because flavored alcohol makers do whatever they want. I am not for arbitrary rule of law. They advertise alcohol on TV, glamorize it, shove it in your face at every restaurant, use "flashy" labels, and encourage the assholes you\'re stuck on a plane with to drink it.\n\nLet\'s recall, too, that only one of these activities creates degenerates (casual drunk driving degenerates, too) and is a leading cause of death. I had multiple friends with a parent dead to alcohol before we were adults--no parents had died of nicotine alone, or even smoking (at least not that early).', "I don't think any of those flavor compounds in the above picture have shown to be toxic.\n\nI think the main aroma compounds to keep out of your ejuice are;\n\n **diacetyl/acetoin** (found in most version 1 vanilla custard flavors, version 2 VCs use butyrate as a safer substitute), \n\n**Cinnamaldehyde** (found in cinnamon flavors) and \n\n**pulegone** (found in some menthol/pepperment flavors).", 'I\'m just envisioning the nightmare scenario where shops start labeling "premium" bottles themselves and SAYING it\'s Vapetasia or King\'s Crest.', 'Fuck the flavors at this point. We need to save vaping altogether. The fake news reports that are doing damage are focusing on vaping in general not flavors.', 'I don\'t think companies should have to stop labeling with images of whatever the flavor contains...a simple enough regulation would be to make these products only available in a strictly vaping shop and ensure that every customer is carded. outside of that, there\'s no excuse to claim that the audiences targeted include teenagers. if a vape shop owner doesn\'t properly id someone, then they should be fined. it\'s simple enough. product packaging is one of the things people look for in their purchasing decisions, and unless they decided to insist on minimal packaging for flavored alcohol, they shouldn\'t have any right to insist that ejuices have to do so. furthermore, we need to start pressing our local/national reporters to be more thorough in their so-called "investigating" and hold them accountable if they are deceiving viewers by conflating vaping products with the shit people are getting sick from. and last but certainly not least, all studies done on these products should be obligated to transparency as far as where the funding is coming from for these false reports, as well as listing all the data used during said studies, rather than strictly giving a summary. we need to know what products they use, what wattage, volts, ingredients in the ejuice they tested, etc.', "What a great idea. We don't need to give the lawmakers and politicians more ammo to make their bogus argument about vaping targeting kids. As an adult vaper, I have thought the labels are ridiculous. I could see the silly labels and ridiculous designs on the mods keep the older crowd away from vaping. Just my opinion though.", 'vaping is a trend?\n\nI thought it was just a safer way to inhale nicotine for us old people.', 'Would you still buy their products if they came with plain white labels? Would you still purchase their bubblegum flavored ejuice if they renamed it to simply "sweet blend". Or does the color of the bottle and name of the ejuice matter to you?\n\nIf the labels and the name matter to you, and that you wouldn\'t buy it unless it was packaged in that way, then I doubt the ejuice is of any good quality.', 'We have been Asking the FDA for about a decade now to set guidelines. They told us that submissions had to be made. Instead we got “ wait for it” and obscure filing information. A few things happened like filing juices and clean rooms. But we basically self regulated. And , to be honest, the Industry overall did a pretty good job. Growing up in an era were even kids cartoons had beings like Fred Flintstone and Disney characters Smoking and Joe Camel as an icon the idea that colorful packaging on Vapes was a marketing device purposely targeting kids is ludicrous to me. I like images of what is the liquid profile on packaging because how else do I know . When companies use only an Icon with names like “Oasis” or “ No52” as the only description? I then have to look up the flavor profile on my Phone?', 'Omg; another one! This is a load of crap! The only way you\'re going to be exposed to ANY of those chemicals is by going through the "BLACK MARKET". DO-YOUR-RESEARCH! The ban is f#@!*& ludicrous. If the it goes through completely,  they will resort to smoking cigarettes that kill "masses" of people yearly, not to mention the fact that we will have another drug war. Statistic show that vaping is 90% healthier for you than smoking regular cigarettes. Go look it up! Up until recently, there were no deaths; "black market".  I have been vaping for 10 years and have had absolutely zero problems. I breath better, can sing better than I did when I was smoking those nasty bastards, as well as not feeling sick or coughing my lungs out; not once has that happened.  I know a lot of people who vape that are a lot healthier as well. ABSOLUTELY  "NO" PROBLEMSI also lost both my grandmother and my dad to emphysema from smoking cigarettes. All of this unnecessary shit needs to stop!', 'That video was referring to the ban based on the toxic THC cartridges.\n\nIm talking about the ban based on the marketing to kids. That ban is justified.\n\nYou really love your cartoon bottle labels? I care more about what the vape tastes like. Your labels are getting my flavors banned.', "I am still against this. Banning the labels is still an infringement of our rights. If I am to sell a product, I should be able to make it look like whatever I want. I don't even care if the package has kids on it, the image on the container is not the issue. Kids getting a hold of them is the issue.\n\nWhile I would rather lose packaging than flavors, I refuse to make that choice. This is not about the children anymore (and I'm not sure it ever was), this is about the government stripping away liberties until nothing is left. \nThe product image is indeed a big deal. Smaller vape juice companies need some method of expressing themselves in order to gain an edge on the competition. There are thousands of juice makers, and only so many flavors exist. Getting rid of labels would destroy brand recognition and their freedom of speech (I'm the sense that their design is a form of expression)", "FINALLY SOMEBODY GOT THE POINT. \n\nGood post man! Very nice it's getting upvoted as well. \n\nWe can also stop creating all sorts of pods and ecigs in all sorts of flashy colors. Which adult actually cares about this stuff?

I wouldn\'t get too excited until this becomes a more widely disseminated headline.\n\nFWIW:  I don\'t see anything on the CDC website that lets nicotine e-cigs off the hook.  ([This article](https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/basic_information/e-cigarettes/severe-lung-disease.html) is dated September 27th)', "It won't, big media companies did their job, now probably won't make a single article on vapes", 'Black market cannabis vaping not cannabis vaping.', 'I tried to send the CDC a note, well, noting that another emergent product I see everywhere is preloaded CBD vape pens that use as the carrier... MCT oil. Like that won\'t give you lipid pneumonia. Vaping oil. They\'re all over the place. And people who use them probably won\'t test positive for THC. It\'s a bit naive of the CDC to assume people will just \'fess up to buying and using black-market THC carts. Especially where THC carts are illegal, period. I hope they tested the people claiming they only vaped nicotine for THC. I\'m not sure if they have that authority. But, really, who volunteers to a bunch of federal investigators they\'ve been using a federally-illegal drug bought out of the back of a truck. Especially when they know the next question is absolutely going to be, "Who/where did you buy them from?" because the CDC has to trace the supply chain?\n\nAlso, people have been vaping e-liquid for 15 years now.  Why a sudden outbreak now of up-to-lethal lung disease? Nothing has changed about e-liquid\'s basic ingredients to trigger a sudden epidemic. Why no epidemic in Great Britain, where vape shops are opening in hospital lobbies? (However you feel about government-supplied healthcare for all citizens (or residents, or whoever can use the NHS\'s services) is that when a country\'s elected government has to pay for everybody\'s health problems, they are a lot more willing to fund research--and listen to it--into the actual-public health utility of vaping to get people off cigarettes. Smokers die slowly of it and get sick from non-lethal chronic illnesses before half or 2/3 of them die of it. The government has to pay the enormous cost of their collective illnesses and hospitalizations for pneumonia and heart attacks and all the nasty stuff cigarettes cause in regular smokers. No tobacco lobby can pay the government off anywhere near enough to cover the price it pays in extra healthcare, lost productivity, etc. Which comes out of every taxpayers\' pockets. They\'ll get voted out of office if the NHS gets overburdened with preventable illnesses, so they do try to prevent them. Though I don\'t think any democracy has the ability to ban cigarettes; people seem to feel entitled to the things; but they can recommend vaping as a much safer alternative when Johnny Smoker gets his first cloudy lung x-ray.)\n\nI did a fellowship at the CDC, and they\'re actually good people. But they are used to epidemics being caused by viruses or contaminated food or something that only sickened, say, people staying in one particular hotel. (That was a real case they solved. Turned out to be contaminants spread via the hotel\'s HVAC system, i believe.) Anyway, the scientists are middle-age-ish and live in Atlanta; they are NOT prepared for an epidemic caused by a change in thickeners used to make thinned-out (cut) THC oil look right again. I doubt they read Leafly articles. A ton of catching up to do on what people vape, how, and even that the typical cartridge battery + THC (or CBD) cartridge is not how people vape e-liquid. As for Juul pod systems, i wouldn\'t quite put it past Philip Morris to adulterate e-liquid pods on purpose to kill off the e-cigarette industry. No I have no evidence and yeah that seems like a stretch; but, really, we\'re talking about people whose main product causes 1 in 5 American deaths. And was deliberately made much more addictive than plain nicotine. Are they willing to kill people? Uh, well, considering they are in the coffin-nail, death-stick industry that serves no legitimate need, obviously yes. Mind you, I\'m not claiming they did any such thing. just meditating on their collective mindset based on the indisputable fact that their products uselessly kill their customers, they know it, and they made it as hard as possible for the latter to quit using their products.

This kind of gimmicky shit gets on my nerves.\n\nEdit: Do these guys really aren't that bad and their juice is actually pretty good, I just thought the gemstone gimmick was kinda ridiculous. It's actually way cheaper online than I expected, my local shop charges $25 for 30ml of their juice so I made assumptions.", 'I\'m selling 100% authentic "diacetyl free" disclosures from a corporation I created in Washington DC called "E-Liquid Testing Laboratories, LLC".

In my opinion mainly because very few people (don\'t blame them I\'m not a mixer myself and I can only imagine the difficulties) have the ability to think outside the box, i.e. by creating vaping experience that does not relate to what we like in food, what we enjoy smelling...\n\n\nAt one point vaping is not eating, neither it is smelling a perfume. Different combinations of flavor out there in our world have to been combined for the vaping experience than the ones we\'re used to. Best example I could give regarding this is boba bounty. Yes it\'s an old juice, yes it had its momentum, but whatever you liked or disliked it people were unable to unanimously describe it. There was no consensus about what it was, you had to experience it, and the proof is that it created a trend of "boba bounty" like and not "cereal" like.\n\n\nAchieving this goal must be difficult I say it again I don\'t blame any sellers or mixers. I\'m pretty sure creating such unique juices right now necessitate something serendipity, because vaping is pretty recent and there is no teaching guide of what is good with what, except of course if we relate to foods.

Things that fall outside common food concepts aren't typically conducive to that. Although I think a lot of juices are marketed with descriptions of the flavor notes, not to engender an opinion but to give you an idea of the overall taste. When you're presenting a bottle of clear liquid I feel its a challenge to differentiate one bottle from another (in food products you can clearly see what a real apple pie is vs a bottle of something flavored like it.)\n\n*edit: missed a word", '[Vape Wilds Take On Overlypriced E-Juice](http://www.vapewild.com/space-pawn-e-juice/)', 'Haha I went to the vape shop I always go to today and looked at their menu and one description of a liquid was "the perfect combination of blue and purple flavor" ', 'The big shop near me is trying to get to 1000 flavors on sample, they have like 280 so far.

Just another amazing customer service post.|*|['Vape wild IS amazing. I will ONLY order juice from them.

Vapewild has broken my spirit|*|['Hey all!\n\nThis does suck. Honestly though, I\'ve vaped Amaizeballs (with a few drips of butterscotch flavoring) for the last few years. The unfortunate truth though is that Amaizeballs is not in the vault. It, with a few other flavors, have been permanently discontinued. And like so many other things going on right now, you have the FDA to thank for that. For those of you wondering why, read on.\n\nFlavor manufacturers such as Capella, Flavor West, Flavour Art, and so on change their flavor recipe from time to time. This is why you often see V1 and V2 flavors from many of these brands. In some cases, they introduce a V2 and discontinue the V1, as has happened in the case of Amaizeballs, Moco Coco Loco, and others. There are a myriad of reasons that a manufacturer\'s flavorings change - a certain component is no longer available so they find a new supply, there was an unintended result of the original formula, they simply wanted to make it even better - the list goes on. But in all of these scenarios the result is a "new" flavoring being created.\n\nThe reason that this is such a problem for vaping is because we, as manufacturers, have had to submit all of our recipe info to the FDA, and, once done, we are not allowed to change it. Each recipe is submitted to them with corresponding "CAS" numbers ([Chemical Abstracts Service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAS_Registry_Number)). The numbers indicate (layman\'s terms here) the chemical make-up of a substance, in this case, flavoring. When a manufacturer creates a V2, this results in a new CAS number, and, if the V1 is discontinued, then we\'re just out of luck.\n\nTL;DR - flavor manufacturer changes a recipe, FDA says we cannot use new recipe in our recipe, and now it\'s just a recipe for disaster\n\nLegit, I wish it didn\'t go down like this. You should have seen my face slide off onto the floor when I found out Amaizeballs was to be no more.', 'Ya that juice is great and I’m really bummed vapewild keeps dropping flavors like this. I don’t care if they’re just “in the vault”. It I can’t order the juice I want then I’m not gonna use their site at all. Why shoot themselves in the foot like this? Doesn’t matter how good their juice is, I can’t imagine why anyone would spend the $50 just to get vault flavors (not even sure if this is included). They’re already overpriced for cheap juice, they just happen to be the best of the cheap juice options.', "Exact same happened to me with 21 Jump Treat and Substance D. I moved on to Psquared and now can't get that.  I'm going to buy from my local shop from now on.

Why I love VapeWild...|*|[]|*|[]
The girlfriend & I both ordered the welcome sampler pack from vape wild, highly satisfied and impressed.|*|['We both ordered the welcome sample pack this past week and got them on the same day, believe it was 2 days after ordering so shipping was very quick. I can’t believe how good of a deal that is, we ended up getting in total 310ml of liquid 8 different flavors for $2.12 which nowadays is unheard of. I am highly impressed with the packaging as well from vape wild along with the free samples, stickers and overall presentation. I will be ordering again based on the customer service alone of Vapewild because I like to support business who actually treat the customer with respect and don’t like I am just another $$ coming in. Thanks again to vapewild for the sampler look forward to trying out all these flavors. ', "My girlfriend and I just ordered ours! Which flavors have you tried?

So, realistically, is VapeWild going out of business, or what?|*|["Just want to step in here and address this again. As far as we all know here, we are not going out of business anytime soon. The specific concerns you've addressed may feel indicative of a closure but the reasons we have provided in the past are still legitimate. Regarding the flavor discontinuance that we went through recently - we are preparing for the PMTA submission process and flavors were eliminated for this reason. Many different factors afffect the decision to eliminate a flavor from our menu. For example, certain flavor concentrates that we have used in the past to make popular VW flavors are often changed on an ingredient level by the manufacturer. Due to the level of consistency that is demanded by the FDA process we are no longer able to rely on that concentrate as it would qualify as a change of ingredient. If you want a more in depth description of this, we've addressed it in a previous post on here about the discontinuance of our Amaizeballs flavor. This posed no issue in the past, however due to the monetary cost of a single PMTA (upwards of $117,000 to around $466,000), it is no longer feasible at all for any e-liquid provider, even one of our size.\n\nThis brings up another important factor that has resulted in less flavors being available. With the potential cost of a single PMTA application, there is no way that we could afford to move forward with all 150 flavors that we originally provided - one of the most overt reasons why we had to begin our elimination process. The cost also addresses our approach to what mg/ml and vg/pg ratios we have flavors available in, as a change in vg/pg or ml/mg qualify as a change of ingredients under the PMTA guidelines and will require separate applications.\n\nWe're aware that we are in the minority when it comes to vaping businesses adjusting their practices in preparation of the PMTAs and that it may look like we are jumping the gun. However, it has always been VW's practice to be the early bird with this sort of thing. In fact, I would go as far to say that a company that has not made any adjustments to their business practices is most likely not planning on being around after PMTA or has so few products that there is no need for adjustments. What we did not anticipate and take preemptive measures towards was the recent painting of vaping in the media or reactionary government policies that followed over the last couple of months.\n\nTo address the flavors that we still provide being out of stock lately, we had a supply chain issue this past month that resulted in a number of stock outs. You should see this improve soon as we fill those again.\n\nIn summary, our gameplan has always been to do what it takes to make it to the otherside of this and from an internal perspective,  I continue to see this approach still.", 'Sad for us vapers in the hell this uncertainty has brought.  Sadder still for the position it has put businesses like you in. \n\nThank you for all you have done for the vape industry and continue to do. I hope your adjustments will keep you in business! The unknown of what may come must keep you all awake most nights. All the best to you!!!!', 'I’d look toward divesting if I was involved in any vape industry related venture. Shit’s wylin out here. Maybe that’s what’s wrong with VW.', "Went to place an order and my ADV, literally the ONLY juice I vape (Frappapow) is gone!!!\n\nI'm furious!

You guys never disappoint|*|["Everytime I made a larger purchase in the past they threw in one or two 30ml bottles. It kept me coming back. This time I bought an Aegis Mini and they only sent the little bottle of mystery flavor and the vape it forward one. It's still freebies, so I'm not necessarily complaining, but now I really have to take that price difference into consideration. Plus living in Texas they have to add tax (not their fault).\n\nBut I'm a little dismayed they haven't address the oxidized nicotine issue that came up a couple of weeks ago. Seems like they are just going to ignore it.  It's a bad look. I'm definitely shopping around a bit more these days.

Addressed 1000x, Yes, But I'm Still Frustrated|*|['Yep, similar story with me. Washington passed a flavor ban back in October ‘19 which prevents me from buying pre-flavored juice, though we can still buy non-flavored and add concentrates to it... And done in the back room of a shop instead of just buying my bottle and being on my way. Much sketchier now than it was before the flavor ban, but the mass propaganda won this battle. Luckily I live right on the border to Oregon which rescinded their flavor ban. \n\nAnyway, so since I was SOL for about 2 months on buying juice any less than a 30 minute drive away, I checked the site and saw it was BARE. Like, actually dry as a bone with all of my favorites done and dusted, so I’ve since had to shop around. There are absolutely great flavors out there to choose from, don’t get me wrong, but this feels like having a favorite Limited-Time item from a fast food joint. They carry it for a while but once it goes away it’s usually gone for good (Rest in peace, McDonald’s Bacon Smokehouse burger).', "I'm also frustrated. I went to buy my favorite menthol flavors and could only get one of my four flavors in 12mg. Could only get that flavor in a pg/vg blend that I never buy, and only in 30ml. I hate to say it but I'm going to have to try to find another vendor and pay twice as much.

Felt like a real crackhead, here’s hoping to quit being a slave to nicotine ✌️', 'crackhead for vaping for sure this is an addiction and a drug, i hope you got past this bro today i am quitting and weaning myself off of this nasty crap my lungs feel so jacked up from 3 years of this', 'Wanna know how I quit?\n\nI stopped. That’s it. No swap Ing in another habit like chewing gum, no cravings, no mood swings. \n\nPut the vape down, and don’t pick it back up - there’s nothing more than that.', 'My boss calls the vape a “Mouth Fedora” and it’s so fckn true', 'this is the best way to quit, never wanna vape again just based on that 😂', "My story is similar to yours. Heavy all day vaper for 3.5 years. Clean for 5 months.\n\nI can't stress the first point enough. GET YOUR HEAD RIGHT. If you are not mentally ready to quit, rather take the time to get to that mental space.\n\nAfter the first 3 weeks, I can't say I have had any 'cravings' more just the 'agh, yeah, a vape would be pretty nice right now that vanishes before I entertain the thought.", 'A little over 1 year ago, I stumbled upon your post.

Im about 8 years into vaping and im really trying to quit too', "That's amazing. 👏  Hope you are still quit, do you have any tips for when the overwhelming urge to vape occurs please? I've decided (about 40 mins ago) to quit (I've been vaping for 2 weeks after quitting for 3wks, following hypnotherapy). But today  something just snapped in my head. It makes me breathless, I don't exercise, I don't do anything for myself, just use vaping to avoid. Your experience as well as OPs, is inspiring and motivating me. 🙌", 'I noticed a lot of people never mentioned this about vaping, but for me (I have severe ADHD) it causes me to become agitated, irritable, anxious and I get really sweaty all the time! I’m not sure if it’s the fact that it’s making my adhd symptoms just that much worse, or my system is just so exhausted from the amount I vape (like a crackhead). I have been addicted to nicotine lozenges for about 8 years! So, I started vaping to maybe switch to and now I’m more addicted to the vaping 👎 I have been through many horrible withdrawals from major addictions but vaping is the most difficult habit to kick that I’ve ever started! It’s completely rediculous considering the longer I go without it, the better I feel and start to feel “normal again”. Unreal. I will save this post though because you are right about getting your head straight first, and that it literally has ZERO benefits as far as feeling good. I don’t get a nicotine rush unless I don’t vape for most of the day and then I just continue to chase the dragons tail and no benefit what so ever..', 'Thank you so much. I’m only 19 and I’ve been doing it on and off for 2 years. A lot of people at my job vape so it’s hard to avoid, but whenever I’ve quit it’s been so easy. Even when I stop or lose my vape for weeks because my adhd brain forgot where I put it, I’m okay. I’ve been seeing a lot of studies that prove how much inhaling vape chemicals can damage your bronchial tubes in your lungs beyond repair (even if you quit) and I just can’t get over seeing it. Everything you said is spot on. I think this really helped my resolve so thank you.', 'This post saved me! After reading this, I instantly bought Allen Carrs ‘how to quit vaping’ and have quit.

I’ve been juuling and buying disposable vapes since I was 16 (3 Years) and I’ve been wanting to quit for good. \n\nI’ve taken tolerance breaks of anywhere between 4 days-1 week. No withdrawals of any form. Therefore I tell myself, “Oh I’m not addicted, I can quit whenever I want, so why not just go buy one more.” \n\nWhy can’t I just stick to my word when I say this is my last one?

I’ve unintentionally stopped after i broke my vape on a drunken night in town, then got a really bad flu this week, and now I’ve (for the first time) have had the urge to stop vaping. Instead of setting up a certain time and date to quit, I think it’s just better to randomly stop one day and just keep it up. The problem is the associations that I have with vaping, as in listening to music, on drives, going to bars and clubbing all while vaping, but it will hopefully diminish within time. Hoping all of us on this sub reddit, successfully quit !', 'I want to quit really bad as I’ve been having minor chest pain and I don’t know if anyone else experienced this while vaping but that’s my main motive to quit I just want to feel healthy again along with I feel like it fuels my anxiety. This was super helpful', 'I’m coming back to this comment. It’s been 6 months. I actually lost my vape then after just buying a new one for the week and was pissed when I couldn’t find it after only a couple days. I saw how it made me look crazy as I literally tore my house upside down just to clean it up and tear it down again because I “really” needed it.

I smoked cigarettes almost 20 years and then started vaping.  And yes, it was better than tobacco.  But it is NOT good.  I am quitting vaping because I am SCARED of it and what it is doing to me.

Let's see how it goes!", "You know the most fucked up part of quitting? It has been genuinely harder than quitting cigarettes. By a solid margin. Quitting cigarettes you have so much going for you. You can't do it inside, it doesn't taste good (unless it's first thing in the morning with black coffee. I'll always miss that). It smells like shit, and makes you smell like shit too.\nSo quitting cigarettes was easy (for me at least).\nBut vaping, I've quit three times in the last 7 years. The longest attempt lasted a little over 6 months. But it keeps drawing me back in. It's just too easy, and too convenient.\nI'm on my fourth go at quitting right now, and I'm just shy of a week in. Kicking the nicotine addiction is the easy part. If you get past day three, you're in the clear. The actual hard part is the addiction to that feeling of bringing something to your mouth, and inhaling. In my experience, it never goes away, you just think about it less and less over time.\n\nGood luck to you all, and hopefully time number four is the final for me 🤙", 'Jesus.. I currently vape but trying to quit, but at a MAXIMUM I only spend $35 a month, which is only $420 a year and $2.1k every 5 years. That doesn’t seem very bad at all, not compared to the 3 grand I spent on cigarettes every year. \nAlso, if you plan on quitting vaping you in fact don’t have to go through the withdrawals, just use gum and/or patches. You’d still have craving though and would have to kick the physical addiction of vaping. Vaping is not bad for you in every way, that’s just not true, it’s 98% safer than cigarettes and will possibly take a year off your life instead of 30 years. Vaping is practically harmless in comparison. But if you didn’t start vaping to get off cigarettes, then I agree and you should quit, there’s no reason for someone to start vaping, but if you’re going to start smoking or start vaping, I’d lead you to vaping 10 out of 10 times', 'A lot better… vaping sucks!', 'One tip I can easily recommend is that if you’re gonna quit vaping, lay off on alcohol until you know you’re officially done with the vape. I’m currently gonna try to start today because everything OP put in this post is so true. After the first morning buzz, it just feels like you’re simply preventing withdrawal by constantly hitting it without the effect of any buzz\n\nIf I could simply vape and put it down and go own with my day I would but it’s impossible for me to not hit the damn thing all fucking day so yeah I’m just gonna chuck my vape in the trash and just start wether I like it or not. Only way to do it.', 'I want to quit so badly, been vaping for around 3 years now, and I started all because it says it reduces anxiety. But this shit is so bad for me, is it a better idea to quit on a weekend so I can deal with the withdrawal then? Or should I be fine going cold turkey from 50mg disposables while I work?', "I think the biggest thing is to not be around other people who are vaping/smoking while you're doing the 2-3 day withdrawal.

70 days nic free - here’s what I’ve found|*|['I get the morning thing, but some nights I’ll be puffing it so much I can’t sleep and end up being awake the whole night hitting the damn thing, and I’ll feel like shit in the morning and keep hitting it. Has anyone else done this or had insomnia from vaping?', 'It happens for me all the time. I vape and close my eyes to sleep and i feel like my mind is spinning. And cant sleep. But now ive been nicotine free for more than one month and its so easy to fall asleep.', 'Ouch. Yeah, I think this happens to me too. \n\nGetting up and walking around or sitting down elsewhere for a few minutes when struggling to fall asleep is the logical thing to do.\n\nAll is good and logical up until that moment I walk over to wherever I left the godforsaken thing and take a few hits. That, on top of sleep issues that may already be partly due to (or aggravated by) vaping is a problem. \n\nI’ve gotten better at this though. To lay in bed and stay there. Vaping is still there before I get into bed which is obviously not good, but I’ve managed to limit that standing up for a few hits to where it isn’t frequent anymore.', 'I did this too. I would stay up vaping in bed then wake up and reach for the vape the second I woke up. It was a nightmare.', 'I always felt a strange sense of sadness when the vape ran out.  Thank you for this write up. I am 7 days in. First 5 days were terrible and confusing times. I never realized I had issues breathing until I stopped vaping. My lungs feel so different.', 'You feel a real difference in your lungs in only 7 days without the vape? Serious question, I’m an athlete and freaked myself out that I ruined my lungs. Day 2 here', "I wasn't paying attention to my tracking app, im 72 days off of nicotine, wow. I honestly can't believe it. I don't really feel much of a difference but everyone is different of course! I have noticed im sleepy all of the time, its so much easier to go to sleep though. I don't think about vaping anymore:)", 'Thank you for the kind words. I so know the pain of those horrible thoughts and I admit I’ve done the whole “I’ll just vape forever and deal with the consequences”! I want everyone to know that there’s light at the end of the tunnel and each and everyone one of us can get through this!', "I'm about 8 months free. I still feel that the best part for me is not having that horrible feeling of 'I cannot keep doing this but I cannot stop' I used to feel anxious about my health and vaping which would make me need to vape to cope with the anxiety. It was a sorry cycle and I'm fucking glad that's long gone.", 'Congrats on 3 months! And yes, the morning thing is a big one for me too, I always hated mornings too and felt like the only incentive to get out of bed was to have a vape (how sad). Now I get up and actually have energy to tackle the day. Isn’t it crazy how much vaping adversely affects us, without us even realising?', 'Woohoo! Day 5! You got passed horrible day 3! Stay strong 💪 I actually didn’t notice the hair thing but I’ve heard off others that they’ve seen improvement with this. Tbh vaping didn’t ruin my hair as much as it did my lungs, skin and mental health. It makes sense that quitting would improve hair though!', 'and the MONEY SAVED. I used to have to budget for these dumb poison pens, sometimes only being able to fill my gas up a certain portion so I could afford a vape if I “needed” it.', "I'm quitting now too left lung pain high blood pressure. No withdrawals yet on day 2 but just trying to stay strong. I love to vape / smoke I quit weed 7 months ago went through painful horrible withdrawals so hopefully nic won't be as bad", 'being more present is such a good point. after about 10 minutes in class, im stressing about ways i can hit my vape without being noticed, constantly waiting for the professor to turn around so i can sneak it. something i never really thought of before but it’s so true. thanks for that', 'I’ve noticed this one heaps. I used to run out of work bang on 5pm as I needed to vape so badly but now I’m happy to stay and actually finish my work because vaping is just not a thing anymore. I can really empathise with what you’re going through!', 'did you notice any changes in the thickness of hair or hair growth? i noticed my hair looks so much fuller and not as dull after putting down the vape', 'Ooooh no I’ve not noticed that actually but that’s awesome! Yay! How long have you been vape free for?', "I quit for 6 weeks before but I felt like my brain was still foggy and I couldn't function very well. Perhaps I didn't give my brain enough time to repair after nearly 10 years of vaping? Not sure but I want to quit again and hopefully this time for good.", "This is amazing, thank you! How did you curb weight gain? I knw a lot of people who never gained anything when they quit, and others who did. i'm on day 3 of no vape, awful brain fog, stomach cramps and irritability, but no weight gain that i can tell yet. Full disclosure, if i do gain weight then i'd probably go back to it, which is ridiculously vain and stupid, but it could happen. So far i havent been eating more though", 'You’re most welcome, I’m glad that it was helpful! \n\nRe weight gain, I am also very vain so I totally get it. I was so worried about this. In truth I did put on a little weight (others didn’t notice it but I’ve always been very petite, so I did) as I was eating so much just to fill that horrible empty feeling. I didn’t weigh myself but I could just tell by looking in the mirror that my body was a bit different looking. \n\nWhat helped me though was really upping my exercise routine - both to improve my lung health after trashing my poor little lungs for so many years, and to balance out the additional calories. Exercise has been my single biggest saviour in this whole journey. \n\nI’m now 138 days vape free and my body is the best it’s ever been as I’m working out so much more than I ever did as a smoker/vaper. \n\nI would really encourage you not to give up if you gain a little weight. Quitting is so, so worth it and you can always lose the weight once you’re out the other side, or do what I did - up your exercise routine and it should balance out. \n\nNothing is more important than ditching the nic!', 'wow all of these hit so close to home!!! i’m 6 days in with no vape, feels amazing.']|*|['I get morning thing night I puff much I sleep end awake whole night hit damn thing I feel like shit morning keep hitting Has anyone else insomnia vaping', 'It happen time I vape close eye sleep feel like mind spinning And cant sleep But ive nicotine free one month easy fall asleep', 'Ouch Yeah I think happens Getting walk around sit elsewhere minute struggle fall asleep logical thing All good logical moment I walk wherever I leave godforsaken thing take hit That top sleep issue may already partly due aggravate vaping problem I get better though To lay bed stay Vaping still I get bed obviously good I manage limit stand hit frequent anymore', 'I I would stay vaping bed wake reach vape second I wake It nightmare', 'I always felt strange sense sadness vape run Thank write I day First day terrible confusing time I never realize I issue breathe I stop vaping My lung feel different', 'You feel real difference lung day without vape Serious question I athlete freak I ruin lung Day', 'I pay attention track app im day nicotine wow I honestly ca believe I really feel much difference everyone different course I notice im sleepy time much easy go sleep though I think vaping anymore', 'Thank kind word I know pain horrible thought I admit I whole I vape forever deal consequence I want everyone know light end tunnel everyone one u get', "I month free I still feel best part horrible feeling ' I keep I stop ' I use feel anxious health vaping would make need vape cope anxiety It sorry cycle I fuck glad long go", 'Congrats month And yes morning thing big one I always hat morning felt like incentive get bed vape sad Now I get actually energy tackle day Isn crazy much vaping adversely affect u without u even realise', 'Woohoo Day You get pass horrible day Stay strong I actually notice hair thing I hear others see improvement Tbh vaping ruin hair much lung skin mental health It make sense quit would improve hair though', 'MONEY SAVED I use budget dumb poison pen sometimes able fill gas certain portion I could afford vape I need', 'I quit leave lung pain high blood pressure No withdrawal yet day try stay strong I love vape smoke I quit weed month ago go painful horrible withdrawal hopefully nic wo bad', 'present good point minute class im stress way hit vape without notice constantly wait professor turn around sneak something never really think true thanks', 'I notice one heap I use run work bang pm I need vape badly I happy stay actually finish work vaping thing anymore I really empathise go', 'notice change thickness hair hair growth notice hair look much fuller dull put vape', 'Ooooh I notice actually awesome Yay How long vape free', 'I quit week I felt like brain still foggy I could function well Perhaps I give brain enough time repair nearly year vaping Not sure I want quit hopefully time good', 'This amazing thank How curb weight gain I knw lot people never gain anything quit others day vape awful brain fog stomach cramp irritability weight gain tell yet Full disclosure gain weight probably go back ridiculously vain stupid could happen So far havent eat though', 'You welcome I glad helpful Re weight gain I also vain I totally get I worry In truth I put little weight others notice I always petite I I eat much fill horrible empty feeling I weigh I could tell look mirror body bit different look What help though really upping exercise routine improve lung health trash poor little lung many year balance additional calorie Exercise single big saviour whole journey I day vape free body best ever I work much I ever smokeSUBREDIT I would really encourage give gain little weight Quitting worth always lose weight side I exercise routine balance Nothing important ditching nic', 'wow hit close home day vape feel amaze']
Read this if you're thinking about vaping again.|*|['Saved. I’ve had no issues quitting vaping in the past. Thought I could just “have a hit or two at holiday parties” last year and I’ve only managed to quit for a few weeks since then.

I want to look back on this comment and smile in the future knowing I put in the effort.', 'Aw man, this post was hilarious to me in such a sad way. I went through a very similar experience. Went a month cold turkey off of vaping. Those first couple of days kind of suck, but after the initial hump I felt a lot better, and as the days went on my cravings got less and less. After that month I was going to watch football with some friends. A couple of them vape, and I thought “you know what, I’ll just buy a disposable to use while I’m hanging out with them, and then I’ll get rid of it afterwards.” Then I decided maybe I could just keep it, and only use it while I’m hanging out with them. Now, I’m back to vaping just to feel “normal” again. \n\nI literally just bought a 4 pack of pods, and felt like shit for doing it. I typed in quitvaping into Reddit figuring there’s a subreddit for it, and this is the first post I clicked on.

I've taken the first step in beginning my journey to quit vaping. How did I get here? Well it started with the very last bottle of juice. Not the good stuff juice. That bottle you find hidden away long ago cause you didn't like it at the time. Desperate to finally end the vape cycle but still hooked. That only bottle left to ease the crave. Down to the last coil that is nearing burnt. Holding onto the mod that you've owned for the last 4 years that no longer keeps the charge. All arrows pointing to either you crack to buy new setup or you hold your ground on quitting. Let's be honest here. A new setup can be pricey. A new mod. New coils. New bottles of juice. Everything under the sun is expensive right now. I can't justify spending money on an addiction that isn't helping me and is making life actually worse. Money that can go towards better things in my life. On top of that. I know vaping isn't good for my health. I know it's affecting my gums and teeth. Which is another motivation to quit. I have to do this for my health. I've been vaping for the last 8-9 years. Before the vape I smoked cigarettes. I know at one point in my life I didn't smoke cigarettes nor vaped. I know I can be free from it. I have to try my best to break the habits. If anyone has any advice that would be appreciated. I was told eating sunflower seeds can help ease craving. I'm really dead serious about quitting. I'm also concerned. I live with others who vape. I'm worried seeing them vape will trigger me back into it. Hearing the vape. Smelling and seeing the clouds. This is probably the biggest factor of the challenge. I can't really escape the vape around me right now. I know this is going to be hard and it's going to suck. I'm going to hold myself accountable each day and try to stay positive. Remind myself why I'm doing this. How this is going to benefit me going forward.", "I too quit 11/2/22 at 6:00. I know because I decided to throw my disposable along with my delta-8 vape as well out of my car window on my way home last night.

Today marks 1 year nicotine & vape free :)|*|['Good questions. I’ll give some context before I answer them to give you an idea of my use. I (25M) started vaping around 17. Throughout the 7 or so years of vaping, it was mainly weekly use. Only on vacations would I vape daily. I decided to drop it completely because I did a lot of research on the harmful effects and it was detrimental to my mental health. It lead to a lot of anxiety and mood problems. Before last year, I was in the process of quitting so I was doing it every few months. Eventually I had enough and wanted to change. The first few weeks were definitely the worse. Mood problems, anxiety, some insomnia, but I did other activities like working out and spending time outside to push through. At around the 3 month mark I finally started to feel OK again. I was able to regulate my emotions and I was a lot happier with life in general. I think surrounding myself with people that don’t partake in vaping and not having it around was extremely helpful. \n\nAppreciate the support!!', 'Thank you!! I separated myself from nicotine and vaping overall and I wanted to change. We’re all going to make it']|*|['Good question I give context I answer give idea use I M start vaping around Throughout year vaping mainly weekly use Only vacation would I vape daily I decide drop completely I lot research harmful effect detrimental mental health It lead lot anxiety mood problem Before last year I process quit I every month Eventually I enough want change The first week definitely bad Mood problem anxiety insomnia I activity like work spending time outside push At around month mark I finally start feel OK I able regulate emotion I lot happy life general I think surround people partake vaping around extremely helpful Appreciate support', 'Thank I separate nicotine vaping overall I want change We go make']

Anyone else think that vaping is a whole different paradigm of nicotine addiction and its effects?|*|["Great post mate. Very well said. Couldn't agree more.\n\nI had the same experience as you, vaped for 5+ years, quit after feeling the way you've described and listening to Allan Carr's book. I'm now 142 days 'nic free'.\n\nFull context - I have relapsed a few times on weekends/nights out. But now that I've seen the absolute slavery of dependence for what it is, I've had zero desire to go back to full daily use after any relapses.\n\nIt's a mentality shift, and it sounds like you've got it! Congrats on quitting.", 'I relapsed after 68 days after drinking beer and didn’t have too much of a hard time carrying on as usual the next day too. I’m not sure I seen it as a “I’m in control of nicotine it’s not in control of me” moment though. Ultimately I still smoked that night, to me it opened my eyes to how addictive it truly is. I still risked it all by smoking, any time I relapse I risk losing it all. If I was truly in control I’d just not smoke ever, I wouldn’t play with fire and push my luck. That’s my opinion and how I look at my relapse anyway.', "Thanks for sharing this.  It reminds me alot of the olden days.  Although probably too young to remember, there was a time when we smoked EVERYWHERE, when secondhand smoke concerns weren't yet a concern.  Smoking was the norm inside everyone's house.  We smoked in bed, at work, in restaurants, concerts, football games, while pushing a cart and shopping in the grocery store.  I made 7 cold war submarine patrols and at least half the crew smoked.  About the only place smoking wasn't permitted was when pumping gas. \n\nThe more controls society imposed, the less smokers were able to smoke, the more nicotine deprived they became, with nicotine tolerance levels (cigs per day) ever so gradually declining, except for the self-employed or few jobs that allowed smoking.  My own boss and smoking three packs-a-day, the day before I quit I was lighting a new one every 15 minutes from dusk to dawn, a pack for the morning, the 2nd by noon and the 3rd by dinner.\n\nAs for nicotine intake comparisons, while relatively easy for science to establish that the average smoker introduces roughly 1mg of nicotine per cigarette smoked and that the average smoker smokes 15 cigs per day, as you note, vaping has no defined stopping point.  On here you read about folks holding their vape in their hand as they sleep and an entire ElfBar being consumed in a day.\n\nWith so many juice nicotine concentration variations, it makes intake comparisons a nightmare.   Instead, we [see vaping studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7668279/) focus on factors such as the average number of puffs per day (365 for the average POD/tank user), weekly e-liquid consumption (median: 32.5 mL/week), and the nicotine concentration vaped (median: 3 mg/mL).", 'So trippy how smoking was so widespread.  I’m only ever reminded of the smell of indoor smoke when I visit a casino or a smoking bar or watch an old timey movie. Very glad they banned it.', 'While I am definitely healthier than when I smoked cigarettes, at least there was a feeling of being “done” after I finished one. You don’t get that with vaping', "It's really crazy how BAD it is for you - but also how quickly your body adjusts to life without nicotine.\n\nPersonally I have been really relishing vape-free life. I quit 1/1 and have really gotten back into fitness, hiking, running, all the stuff I avoided while I was addicted to vaping. \n\nFor a while there I would crave nicotine when drinking but something happened and now I am just not into it at all. It's pretty awesome and I hope you can stick to it.", 'Absolutely. This is embarrassing but I switched back to cigarettes before quitting because cigarettes force me to slow down the intake and I become disgusted with them and the smell and the feeling. The first few days back on cigarettes, I was literally going through withdrawal while still smoking as many as I wanted. My body had to adjust back to good ole fashioned tar-in-the-lungs nicotine rather than the cross-the-blood-brain-barrier nicotine salt chinese space drugs they put in Elf Bars. It was good for me to have to think more about getting my fix. It was good to make it less convenient.   \n\n\nNot making any recommendations here because everyone is different, but this helped me.', 'This makes a ton of sense. Some of us started valuing to quit smoking but I had the same thought - quitting cigarettes might be a better strategy for all the reasons you just listed.', 'Nailed it! Best description of the awful vape trap conundrum I have read. For me it’s  7 days today, it feels great to be back in the world. Feel like I hit *pause* on my life while I was addicted and now I’m back. Cheers and good luck.', 'Absolutely well said. When I first quit I realised how fkn lazy I was. Why leave my bed and work for my dopamine and other happy chemicals when I could get a free hit of it right here??? I didn’t want to go anywhere I couldn’t bring my vape. You’re absolutely right about not being in the present moment - always gravitating between the past and the future hit. In my city I see people vaping everywhere and that’s the scary thing to me', '10000% I was a smoker for a decade and about 2 months ago decided to try and quit and use vaping.. Well I\'m 100x more addicted to vaping than I ever was cigarettes. Spending more money too.\n\n1 pack of American spirits used to last me at least a week. I could easily go a full day of work without a cigarette, usually I\'d smoke a half on my way to work, a half on my way home. Then maybe a half after dinner. Maybe a little bit more on a day off when I\'m doing yard work or cleaning etc. Or a little more if I was out adventuring.\n\nAll in all I\'d smoke between 1-3 cigarettes a day, and I\'d been that way for over 10 years...\n\nMy vape addiction came on fast and strong, vaping when watching a movie. Reading a book. Taking a bath. If I misplace it I get super anxious.\n\nNo more sitting on the porch with the dogs and smoking a lil cig.\n\n\nI def don\'t miss the smell of cigs, my husband is still smoking and I really notice it now. But he is also a very casual 1 - 2 cigs a day smoker.\n\nHe hates the vaping and points out I\'m obsessed.\n\nToday I noticed a lot of zero nicotine options at the store and I think I\'m going to quit next time mine runs out.\n\nI recently quit a 15 year serious caffeine addiction, and that was rough but I\'m about 7 weeks in and I no longer miss it or even think about it.\n\nI\'m ready to let my brain be my brain free from both nicotine and caffeine.\n\nI know going to zero will be really hard but I\'m thinking I can\'t go "cold turkey" just yet\n\nI truly can\'t believe how fast this snuck up on me\n\nSo many of my friends that used to smoke are vaping now and I see the same in them.', 'Well said.\n\nI vape so much, that my legs go wobbly and I have difficultly getting down steps and walking down slopes.\n\nI have given up so many times and it is not pleasant.  Going to have another go next week.', "I'm 2 weeks vape free today (still using nic gum about once a day) and this is so accurate. Especially working from home. I was on vacation when I quit so it was actually easier. Now I'm back home and working and it's a struggle. Before I would literally vape all day everyday while working. I feel like I'm missing a piece of me and having a hard time focusing on my work.", 'Oh yes, definitely. \n\nThere are chemicals in cigarettes that make cigarettes more satisfying the vaping nicotine. You can come close with nicotine salts but that’s a little tough. Also I felt more substance addicted when vaping- I had a hard time being satisfied with the vape and it was only like 20 minutes later when I wanted to vape again. I was inhaling more vape/day than I ever did cigarette smoke/day.', 'This is the best post I’ve read ever. Literally nailed it. I needed to hear this. I’m 3 1/2 weeks without vaping and the hijacking comment was so accurate. I feel so much more present. I’m also wayyyy more motivated and don’t obsess over a hit.

I got through the worst by chugging water or eating every time I got a craving, you do start to realize that most cravings are your body wanting food or water, not always nicotine. Hard candy specifically lollipops or jolly ranchers. Also making hot tea, specifically chai, camomile, ginger/lemon, was soothing during cravings. Also don’t feel bad about just sleeping forever, I felt like it took a week for all the juice to work out of my system and I was super fatigued while quitting, exercise helped some to bring energy up… just light cardio and working outside.

Thank you for your post!', 'Here is where I am. I was a cigar smoker and cigarette chipper for 20 years. Never got addicted. I enjoyed tobacco but I did it on my own terms. Went for weeks or months without a regular smoke and never felt the obsession to have it, yet truly enjoyed every puff when I did.\n\nVaping came along and totally changed the game. I could have it anytime, anywhere without smell or social ostracism. Based on the convenience, I became addicted.\n\nNow one month off of vape and snus, I obsess about tobacco.

I would take a hit of my vape to get an instant relief and happiness hit.\n\nWithout the vape, I have been forced to handle these emotions properly. If I’m feeling low, I now need to seek out something that makes me feel better (like fresh air, a video game, loud music) rather than just relying on a vape to mask the feelings with a (fake) happiness hit.\n\nAlso just being able to appreciate a nice walk without being breathless has absolutely changed my life for sure.', 'I’ve been trying to quit. I’ve found when I feel like I’m about to lose my mind bc I need my vape… I bought some coffee straws to get the feeling out smoking & it helps tremendously. Just remember it’s an obsessive thought.

Vaping is worse than smoking|*|['As someone who smoked for 10ish years as well, and then switched to vaping for another 5-6 years, this is all true. It’s insane how much more addicting vaping is. I had quit vaping for 6 months and then failed. It’s taken me over a year to try again, multiple tries at that. Couldn’t make it past a day each time. I’m starting day 3 now. Praying to make it to the other side this time.', 'Excuse me, how much nicotine were you vaping? I know lot of countried have a legal limit at 20, but just for curiosity would love to know yours. Thanks!', 'Very similar story here. 10 years cigs and just under 10 vaping. Quitting cigarettes was 100x easier. Especially after nicotine salts came around. I work from home so I was vaping constantly when I wasn\'t around other people. \n\nI\'m 48h vape free as of a few minutes ago holy shit, it was harder than getting off of heroin in some ways. \n\nIf someone can invent a vape that gives you the "throat hit" while reducing nicotine slowly over a month, it\'ll save a lot of people from a similar hell. \n\nI just got off of Kratom and vapes over the past 2 weeks, and weed and methadone over the last month. I\'m using nicotine patches but plan to stop that once the oral fixation habit is over. But damn, I\'m feeling healthy, proud of myself, and like everything is going to suddenly be easier. Travel, dating, work, focus...\n\nVapes are bad bad news.', 'The industry is so shit, I started vaping underage, because it “wasn’t that big of a deal” and I’m still legally underage for nicotine. I’ve tried to research diff nic free devices that still give a minty throat hit, and in my experience they are harder to get than ur average vape. Call me crazy but it’s like the producers don’t want us to try and quit. \n\nAnyways, I’m really happy for you :) that feeling you get from even just being a couple days clean is so freeing, like you can do anything. keep fighting!', "When I first stopped at a vape shop, the sales associate told me if I wanted to use it as a smoking cessation, I should continue smoking and count how many puffs I take of a cigarette and how many I smoke a day, then switch to vaping and only take that # of puffs. Great advice! I didn't follow it though lol", 'Actually, I think that is a useful way to stop smoking', 'This 10000%. I\'ve smoked since the age of 14, then switched to vaping in my mid-twenties (couple years ago)\n\nAt one point I was smoking a pack a day. But I\'ll tell you, I\'m convinced I\'ve been smoking much much more on the vape, if anything from a nicotine perspective. Particularly on salts, the amount of nic you\'re ingesting is astronomical - especially since, like me, it sounds like you were a daily chain vaper. Working from home, vape in hand, it\'s non stop.\n\nI quit a little over a month ago "cold turkey". And I use the quotes because I\'m still chewing a few pieces of nic gum a day. Slowly decreasing the gum, but my vaping habit and nic addiction were so severe that it literally was impossible for me to quit without some sort of assistance. And I guess even now I\'m not 100% nic-free.\n\nBut good on you, seriously. This stuff is poison and the naysayers are just being hoodwinked. People thought smoking was harmless too for the first few decades of its introduction into the mainstream', 'Yep - I agree, depending on what you mean by "worse than smoking." From an addiction standpoint, absolutely! Sure - it\'s "healthier" than smoking burnt tobacco leaves/carcinogens from a cig, but the levels of nicotine consumed and the frequency of intake from vaping is FAR higher than that of smoking cigarettes.\n\nYou wouldn\'t chain smoke a bunch of cigs in your bedroom all day or sneak in a puff while you\'re sitting in your office (or maybe you would), but you would with a vape; much more frequently due to the lack of odor, stealthiness, and convenience  - constantly increasing the levels of nicotine in your body and cravings for nicotine.\n\nIn fact, many people who previously did not smoke are now vaping with a heavy addiction (me, for example, and I hate myself for it)! \n\nThe vape does not leave my-side while I\'m working from home all day, driving, getting ready to go to bed, watching tv....It\'s terrible! I\'ve since switched to only vaping 25mg or lower with exchangeable coils, since the disposable only come in 50mg and I was going thru those like candy. But still, I\'d love to come off of it for good. It so damn hard, because it tastes so good and I can literally feel my body  craving the nicotine.\n\nUgh, maybe I\'ll start tomorrow!', 'Well, you almost nailed it to the point, but ill just add one more detail to wrap it up completely.\n\nBesides the higher nicotine consumption and being it harder to quit altogether - from my POV vaping inflicted more visible damage to me then cigarettes ever did.\n\nLet me explain. \n\nCigarettes are far worse for you health vise, and inflict alot more damage to internal organs than vaping. Theres no arguing there. And while i knew i was poisoning myself with them, i never experienced any visible or noticable side effects rather than smelling like an ashtray and suppressed sense of smell/taste.\n\nI cant say the same about vaping. Every aspect of me and my body has been negatively impacted by vaping with me noticing it.\n\nGuess the point is, vaping is saf**er** than smoking on the long run, but its not in any way, form or shape **safe** as people think it is, and it still drags alot of known and unknown problems with itself.

Quit the cigs with vapes. Vaped for 2 years. Quit the vapes 7 months ago. I agree with you. Vapes are harder to quit.', "Have you ever quit cigs without vapes ?\n\nIf not, saying vapes are harder to quit isn't quite accurate because if you quit cigs by vaping that's not difficult at all because you just went from one nicotine source to another", 'From my experience- smoking caused way more nasty side effects than vaping. I wouldn’t call vaping cheap either- 25$ ever week per person just for juice is pretty steep for my area. Of course I used a mod- I didn’t do disposables like a lot of people are doing now. That being said I never got the gum issues or circulation issues from vaping. I got what I call nicotine sickness from it (but I also got those from cigarettes too) I only had those when smoking. I’m happy to say I haven’t vaped in almost 7 months though. Been even longer since I smoked a cigarette.', 'Happy for you for getting trough it and quitting altogether.\n\nNevertheless, vaping - atleast from where i live, on monthly basis is 7x cheaper than smoking ( disposables aside, speaking of DIY ) ,also all side effects mentioned in the post above were in fact caused due to vaping', "Damn man, been vaping 7 yrs damn near nonstop, on and off with cigs but mostly vaping and ever since I started using salt nic(especially the horrible juul), I've had many of the issues you've mentioned and probably had them before too. Just never noticed, smoking cigarettes fucks with my health/lungs heavy and I'm at the point where it's super hard to quit nic, so I whole heartedly agree with your post.\n\n\nFuck nicotine and being a slave to this whack ass drug, it doesn't even get you high or anything, just becomes an embarrassing habit you have to support because you're a full blown addict.", 'No one can ever convince me vaping is worse for you than smoking cigarettes health wise. There are very few things worse for you than cigarettes.\nI smoked for around 7 years and vaped for about that long. I stopped vaping 5 months ago and I haven’t noticed any difference in my breathing or health. I did notice a positive change when I switched from cigarettes to vaping. No more coughing when laughing too hard, no more coughing up green phlegm in the morning, no more shortness of breath, my extremities had blood flow again, I could exercise, and I haven’t gotten sick with a respiratory infection since I stopped smoking in 2016. Not saying vaping is harmless. But no way is it worse for you than cigarettes.', 'Its based on personal experience, so take it with a grain of salt since its anecdotal.\n\nMe personally ,ive experienced more side effects from vaping rather from smoking. Effects which slowly creeped up and were much more prompient than short term effects from smoking ( phlegm, smell, hungover alcohol combined headaches )', 'My moms been smoking cigarettes for most of her life has great gums, I baked for three years and my gums started receding im 3 months clean at the end of October', 'That’s an interesting point. When I used to smoke cigarettes, I had maybe 3-4 a day. But in my 7 years of vaping, I never once let up the vape from my pocket. Id puff morning afternoon and night and every moment in between. That being said quitting vaping was much easier for me than expected. I know it’s different for different people. But the 3 day trick is all that was needed for me.', "I'm not promoting vaping by any stretch but I've had a weird relationship with it. Like I don't crave it the way I craved cigarettes. It'd be mostly a social thing where I only crave it when I'm drunk. But when I'm sober the next morning and use it, it tastes empty to me. And it'll either do nothing or it'll make me anxious. It's a waste of money.\n\nI do know that it does get very addictive for others, including close friends that vape all day, every day. While I'm glad that it's not like that for me, I'd still not rather vape at all. Not even socially. Being able to vape inside as it isn't smelly and messy as cigarettes, isn't really a benefit. It feels like a pacifier or a gift that keeps giving, for lack of a better term. \n\nAlthough my cardio at the gym is much better compared to when I smoked, it's still not good for you.", "You guys gonna laugh, but that's why I temporarily switched from vaping liquid to dry herb vaping tobacco.", 'I experienced all of your vaping symptoms when I smoked cigs. None of those symptoms now, aside from that I do feel I am extremely nicotine dependent. But, I am always hydrated, great teeth/gum health, and work out 6 days per week (boxer and run Spartan races) so not sure if your lung capacity is due to vaping or just being out of shape.', "I am afraid I disagree with you about a few things here. My experience is a bit different than yours and I think everyone is different anyway, so I hope you will have the tolerance to hear me out.\n\nI was smoking cigarettes for fifteen years and then switched to vaping and when I did my health improved tremendously in terms of coughing, recovery, stamina, etc The only two side effects I noticed were a slightly higher heart rate especially when I vape and sometimes I feel I cannot take a full breath in, but I kind of had this last problem since I was young but perhaps vaping makes it a bit worst.\n\nApart from that I was a very happy vaper for five years but recently it started to bother me because of the very reason you mentioned I found out that I breathe more vape than oxygen, besides some other technical problems with a vape like spitting back, dry hit, burned coil, etc. I also hated the idea that I was keep puffing most of the time around my kids, I set a very bad example! And I couldn't see myself in the future keep vaping. So, I quit 15 days ago and it was the best decision and I hope I can stick to this and I wish everyone also quit specially if vape doesn't make them happy.\n\nPeace ✌", "My friend. You and I share the same story. I mean... Exactly... I could have written your text. Same different vape experience regarding health, same reason to quit. We even stopped at the same time 😄. I really wish you good luck. Keep your head up and let's be a good role model for the kids ⭐", 'Vaping destroys your lungs, smoked for many years, switch to vaping and the vaping damage seems to be worse and sticking around longer.  3 months of no nicotine in a few days, between the 2 of them probably took 15 years off my life.', 'I agree. If for some reason I ever picked up nicotine again, it wouldn’t be a vape it would for sure be a cigarette. Despite vapes “technically” being healthier (which i don’t believe with the rates people\nconsume them) i smoked cigs for about a year and started vaping because of it being “healthier” even though i vaped for 3 years like non stop. and quitting took like 8 tries til i finally went cold turkey for real about a year ago. I personally noticed more effects from vaping than i did cigs. Basically, u can control urself with a cigarette, a vape you can not. Yeah some people can, but very few. Most of us are here because we have it in our hand almost all moments of the day', 'Also the amounts of nicotine salts most of us were/are taking in are corrosive to the lungs. also with synthetic vapes and people not even knowing it is synthetic, which is going to become more and more popular and has been with disposables', "I agree 100% its not seen as bad and you can do it anywhere. I recently relapsed around early september after not buying one for 2 years. I had my ocasional urges where'd id hit one when I was drunk but never hit them more than a few times. I also would have stints of smoking weed and carts in those two years as well. I finally caved in and started vaping and getting really drunk everyday for a couple weeks then stopped. I woke up a few times gasping for air when I quit that first week again. Then when my lungs started to feel normal again I vaped and smoked weed and drank heavily throughout the weekend. Today is day two of no vaping or alcohol and I was going to go to bed but got extremly short of breath. I did have covid a few months ago as well as being an asthmatic.

Hardest part so far is after a meal, vaping or smoking always felt like a period at the end of a sentence.|*|['omg this is genius LOL, I feel the same terrible craving after meals almost like for a split second I forgot I’m vape free and try to reach for it. I need to start doing something like this hahah', 'Damn I feel this lol. I’m 14 months off and there are still moments when this hits me. My revelation was I needed to intentionally slow down when I was eating. I realized that for the last many years I was just shoveling my food down so I could go vape. So after quitting I was still eating really fast and then not having that moment after of going and vaping. May not apply to you but that helped tremendously once I figured it out.', 'I’m on my third week, and same. It seems like I literally cannot stop eating either because I don’t vape after.']|*|['omg genius LOL I feel terrible crave meal almost like split second I forget I vape free try reach I need start something like hahah', 'Damn I feel lol I month still moments hit My revelation I need intentionally slow I eat I realize last many year I shovel food I could go vape So quit I still eat really fast moment go vaping May apply help tremendously I figure', 'I third week It seem like I literally stop eat either I vape']

Disposable vapes are pure poison. Huge difference in quality of life after quitting|*|["Disposables are extra terrible I swear It just takes a couple hits for my lungs to feel fucking weird and heavy... they irritate the shit out of my throat too. I thought I had bad allergies but nope it was the vape as soon as I stopped my tonsils shrunk back down.  Really gross and I have to clear the mucus out of my throat constantly.

Idk if u had any of these symptoms", "I remember the first time I tried quitting after 2 or 3 days I started coughing up this weird gunk- it's like whatever gunk the vape coated my lungs with was coming up and out :,)... I'm on day 2 now trying again, so we'll see what happens lol", 'I’m almost a year off of vaping after being horribly addicted and the thing I noticed the most for myself was how much easier it was to wake up and get out of bed for work in the morning. Truly wild how much it was holding me back.', "I did the same as you man - threw away all my shit to give up, slipped up, and ended up buying disposables for a few months again. I definitely noticed some of the shit you were getting. I wonder what the hell is going into those things? Knowing good old chinese quality control we've probably been vaping machine cleaner. \n\nBeen e cig free for over a month now and feeling great (I still use a dry herb vape to consume some weed but feel miles better even with that)", 'This is me exactly, except I’m female… still, same symptoms.  Same thing happened when I bought a vape and started vaping after a month of quitting - those immediate symptoms showed me just HOW TOXiC and POISONOUS vaping is.  And how fast they returned. \nI don’t recall ever feeling that nauseous, sick and fatigued until I used disposable vapes (for convenience cuz I got sick of buying juice and pods and batteries etc ).  Two years of disposables did me in. \nNever. Again.', 'I used disposable myself, I had gotten around 5-6 times only but I got so addicted, between them I started gums but ended buying more disposables since gum triggered urge to vape more, but 3 months ago I called my girlfriend pretended I’m-taking  a puff and threw it from the bridge( dont worry its not like a freshwater or something below was basically sewage) my girlfriend hates me abusing anything and I’m a non smoker so I made this gesture that I’m quitting. But few hours ago I ended up buying a disposable again. I talked to my girlfriend that it’s getting hard for me to go cold turkey since months so can I get a Pod and basically fill it w 0 nic. She had agreed but idk what got into me and I got a 2% disposable and I really hurt her. Just an hour ago me and my friend smashed the vape on the floor and destroyed it to bits. I’ll keep relying JUST ON GUMS. And f*ck it its not worth it. Nic gums give you enough confidence to get through the day and doesn’t make you so dizzy like the vape does.

Want to announce I’m 1 month vape free, after a very long, difficult struggle to quit. I’m down 15lbs, feeling better than ever after the pain of withdrawal & relapse finally wore off.

I just call it a pang, it helps me be mindful of what I’m actually feeling and helps me not feel distressed when I notice the pang. The distress is what makes you cave into the pang, and if you can notice the pang without feeling anxious about it, it makes quitting much easier', 'Proud of you!! I’m going almost a month strong, and I was the same way. Smoking EVERYWHERE. Even in places I wasn’t allowed to. \nMy mom went into the hospital on a ventilator, and I thought “well I’m super stressed so I can just vape a little” but then I realized that I can make new healthier coping mechanisms.

This is very motivational for me. I gave up at 4 days, no idea why. I didn’t feel anything when I hit the vape but continued to do so anyway now I’m back to square one', 'Congrats on 2 years that’s amazing. It was the same realisation for me that lead to me having to put a total stop to it.

I was able to quit for 9 months in 2020 following a surgery but I picked up a vape following a day of drinking in 2021 & haven't put it down :( I have two vapes and I keep them charged at all times and vape non stop, I hate it but I'm so scared about how I will feel as I'm coming down from nicotine. Did you do any patches or gum etc to help?", 'I’m not OP, but I’m just now 11 days free. I tried nic gum and honestly found it worthless. It made my mouth tingle a little but did nothing to satisfy the urge to vape. I also tried a flavored nicotine pouch and it made my mouth and throat tingle and felt like it would burn a hole in my lip/gums if I did it regularly. \n\nI guess it’s probably because wasn’t just the nicotine I was hooked on. It was the whole process of vaping. Needing it in my hand at all times, can’t move to a different room in my house without it, shit like that.

I think the hardest thing for me has been unlearning instant gratification|*|['This is also my fear. I feel like I’m never “genuinely” happy.

When I was 15 food was a massive outlet for me, it gave me that rush of serotonin- which lead to me gaining a lot of weight. I switched to nicotine instead and lost the weight.

Dont enough times and combined with the metals and sticky chemicals it doesn't take much to destroy those little air sacks causing a pneumothorax or collapsed lung. Sorry for lack of proper terms.

Over a year clean after 18 years of addiction - Tips from my journey|*|['The “mind games”, The way you described this is so incredibly accurate. Here’s a tip that helped me: learn every trick in the book so you aren’t caught off guard. If you know what your own mind will try telling you to get you to smoke, you’re prepared.\n\nIn the first few weeks, you’re mind will play any kind of trick it can to get you smoking. The mind can be a crafty bugger. Besides trying to trick you into thinking you need it, It will tell you stuff like “see those people over there, look how comfortable they look with a cigarette”.\n\nI actually became “depressed” (for lack of better word) at my first attempt to quit. I don’t believe I was truly sad or anything: was one of the ways my mind tried getting me to smoke. \n\nThat’s the thing: when you cut smoking to the bare minimum of what it is, the thing lasts about 5 minutes and after that 5 minutes.. it’s nothing. You eventually realise that smoking one  wasn’t even worth it. The next one might keep you busy/distracted for a few minutes, but when it’s over.. what now? Smoke another? It’s all so temporary that being trapped in the revolving door is not worth it.\n\nThis is also why vaping is a bitch. You can puff on that thing constantly, all day every day unlike a cigarette which has a start and a finish. My next goal is to quit vaping. While I’m glad I took that as a step to quit smoking, I might have run into a problem of being heavily reliant on a vape.', "Thank you so much.

Once those battles were won, I had to fight the urge during a party once again, or being in nature. Different settings brought out the urge to smoke again even if I was off cigs for weeks.

An unexpected benefit of quitting|*|['For me, yesterday marked 2 weeks nicotine free after 5 years of daily use. I’m sitting here in my living room, knowing that my sister’s vape is not even 15 feet away sitting on the nightstand in her room. My addiction’s voice is loud, and the urges are strong. So I opened up Reddit hoping to see something from this sub to motivate me, and here you are. The first post I see. You just supported me on my journey, and I thank you with my whole heart for that. 💕', 'This makes my heart so happy 💕 I’m so glad that I could help. This is a really amazing community and really helped me to quit too. I started scrolling this whenever I felt like a vape and it kept me accountable. Keep it up, you can totally do this!', 'Holy shit, I haven’t even thought of how difficult it would be if someone in my house still had a vape around when I’ve quit. Props to you!', "Great message, I'm 2 weeks in and I don't ever ever ever want to vape in my life again, no smoking no pulling anything other than air. Its been coming for so long I have quite before and I always relapsed after a few months etc. But this time I know its different I feel its different and my mind regarding everything is different. I'm mostly here reading to see after 2 weeks 0 nicotine I then quit completely and its been 2 weeks without anything, I have this PAIN on my lungs that irritates me, I hope its the lungs starting to heal more and more so trying to see if everyone has that symptom.  I really like your last sentence it really resonates with me.", 'Good message, my experience quitting is a bit different, as soon as I stopped vaping I started eating trash food on a daily basis to calm the anxiety and my weight increased drastically in a bad way, the vape used to regulate my calories intake and make me feel good and confident, now I can say I feel emotionally/physically worse than before vaping', 'Oh that sounds awful. I’m so sorry to hear. How long have you quit for? \n\nI went through the trash eating and feeling pretty awful phase for quite some time. It’s taken me a while to come the full circle and realise how much vaping was ruining my life. \n\nAt the start when I was feeling really shit and mourning the loss of the vape/complaining about how shit my life was without it, someone said to me: “so vape, nobody is stopping you”. It really stuck with me because it made me realise that quitting is a choice and if I really hated life so much without it, I could start again whenever I wanted. That in turn made me realise that I don’t want to vape, or even like vaping - I’m just an addict.\n\nMaybe remind yourself that if you really feel that vaping enriched your life and you need it, you are free to start again. Then think about why you haven’t done so yet. That’s your “why” and will keep you accountable amidst the shitness.\n\nGood luck with it. I know how tough it is.', "I don't have much to comment but just wanted to say, thank you for sharing this. I've subtlety noticed the same thing, quite a lot actually and it feels amazing (albeit I'm about a week in though this time quitting feels infinitely different and much stronger for some reason). I feel a bit like a fraud because I am using the patches religiously to help quit, but I am very proud of myself for not physically vaping anymore and getting rid of it. Congrats on your journey friend!", 'Hang in there my friend, if I can do it literally anyone can do it. I was so addicted and really thought that I was too far gone and figured at one stage I’d just have to vape until it killed me because I couldn’t possibly stop.

a rant about pro vaping subreddits|*|['Honestly I have to stay away from places like those. Part of my quitting is researching all the insidious things behind not just vape companies but also the tobacco and nicotine industry overall. One thing that catches my eyes, is that cigarette producing companies knew for a loooong time how dangerous they were. They hid it for decades. Until someone blew the whistle and they were forced to expose everything and label it as dangerous. It just makes me think, what could these companies producing vapes know that just isn’t shared yet? And considering it is relatively new, what if later down the line when more info is available, it turns out to be unhealthy, similar to the path of cigarettes? I don’t visit those kinds of subreddits, but even on social media as a regular young adult, it’s so hard seeing someone post about how vaping is hurting them and the comments just go on with “im hitting my vape anyway” “lmao ok” and all that.. I just mostly am mad at the companies for duping my generation, which was so close to ending rampant nicotine addiction, into vaping 🙄', 'My biggest concern is if it’s somehow even WORSE than cigarettes…', 'Like on tiktok. I deleted that cesspool of an app but anytime I saw somebody make a post about wanting to quit nic or something like that, everyone would just be acting negative and saying things like **hits vape**   But that app is mostly teenagers', 'And the insane thing is, the cigarette companies fought tooth and nail to convince everyone that smoking was safe! I was a kid I knew that was bullshit, my grandmother smoked for decades and decades and it wasn’t hard to put 2 and 2 together when it came to her getting lung cancer. But the fact that the cigarette execs were on TV, in a COURT of LAW, saying “our research shows smoking has no impact on health.” With a straight face.Like I bet does! It’s infuriating.', 'Sort off topic but also related . I never had withdrawal when I use to stop smoking cigs. I was a casual smoker? Idk but when I quit vape every single time I had major withdrawals! Vape made me more addictive to nic then cigs because of how accessible it is. Not to mention I think my blood pressure got higher from hitting a stimulate all day.', 'Vape nicotine content also significantly higher than cigarettes', 'Plus, you typically have to go outside for a cigarette. With a vape, it’s a non stop thing all day', 'I was a long time smoker. I didn’t have withdrawals at all. Cravings, yes. But I had major withdrawals these past few days from quitting vapes.', "Yeah ok.\n\nSince I have stopped vaping (just 12 days) I have observed the following:\n\n* I don't get a chesty rattling phlegm cough after eating. Used to choke me and I'd have to sit there waiting for an opportune moment to step away and cough\n\n* My legs don't hurt\n\n* I can take a deep breath\n\n* I don't get winded from taking the stairs to the third floor\n\n* My skin and eye bags look way better (I'm also sober off everything else so that helps too)", '14 days for me!!! \n\nthe rattling phlegm cough after eating omg. i just recently realized that too that’s so strange. but yeah after quitting i haven’t had a really wet cough after eating. i wonder what caused that? yeah it was always awkward to step away to the bathroom at someone’s house to let out a few nasty coughs. the last few months i vaped i always felt like i needed to clear my throat. and thinking about it now… i haven’t had to clear my throat before talking since i quit.\n\nit’s crazy how much more it was affecting us than we thought.', 'I quit 6 days ago and I don’t feel any improvement in my cardio unfortunately. When I switched to vaping from cigarettes my cardio became sooo much better in no-time.

I don't think people realize this and it will soon be recognized as a public health problem.", 'To be fair, that was me, unpopular opinion, but I don’t think it was that terribly hard to quit the salt vapes. It was rough for a month but now i’m at a year and I never get a craving. I think it CAN be broken, maybe not as easy as cigarettes, I don’t think it’s a lifetime addiction.', "The only thing I dislike is that people on the other side act like vaping is just as bad if not worse than cigarettes and it's just not true. No one being honest with themselves ever said it was 100% safe, but it's degrees *safer* than cigarettes are that the attempts to ban it are fucking ridiculous. I believe it legit helps people that have trouble kicking nicotine addiction but want a better alternative. \n\nThat being said, since I've stopped vaping, my chest pain and occasional SOB are gone. The aching pains in my legs and groin are gone. My GERD symptoms have gone way down. My anxiety is so much better and I feel overall healthier in mind and body. I don't have insomnia  anymore either. I was one of those people that chain vaped daily for years. \n\nI think what's needed is honesty, it's hard to know what's the truth when both sides are willing to exaggerate if not outright lie to get their points across.", 'Agreed. Although I’ve been vape free for 2 weeks and only vaped socially, mostly when drinking, my cardio was WAY better when I only vaped compared to when I smoked. No question. Sure vaping isn’t 100% safe but considering you’re not inhaling tar and carbon monoxide, I don’t see how vaping could be considered worse than smoking. \n\nI was never out of breath when using vapes but I was when I smoked cigarettes and tried running. Once I quit smoking, my endurance and breathing improved a lot over time.', 'Can vaping cause leg pain??', 'Vaping is definitely better than smoking but we can’t say it’s healthy. I’d say that the worst part about vaping isn’t even the lung damage but the psychological effects of nicotine addiction', 'I think vaping is more dangerous than cigarettes because it exposes users to way higher levels of nicotine and also appeals to a younger generation of nic fiends who can now sneak rips whenever they want.', "I would think it's better, but honestly can't say for certain. It also may not be an apples to apples comparison in 15 years if side affects are different enough. \n\nI mostly struggle with the nicotine addiction now that california banned the good ejuices. I had to pick up a small vuse from a gas station and realized the vapor isn't what gets me off. It's the nic. I'm probably going to go full-time nic gum soon here, and hopefully can switch to no nic gum after a while of that.", 'It’s easy to understand why there are large communities, like in that subreddit, who hype up and defend vaping. I’m not saying that it is good. There are plenty who turn a blind eye to the health effects.\n\nLike with any addiction, there will be some way to justify it. “\nIt doesn’t contain ___”\n“it’s better than ___”\n“at least I don’t use ___”\n\nTake cigarettes as an example. The reason there are “light” cigarettes? It creates a false sense of choice. The illusion of making the “healthier” choice, blurring that all-or-nothing of something being either good or bad for your health. \n\nBy creating “degrees of risk”, it becomes easier to fall into the trap of thinking you’re making the healthier choice. \n\nAnother example. “Yeah, I have a few drinks every evening… glasses of wine. At least I’m not drinking vodka every night!”. Degrees of risk. A false sense of making the better choice despite the reality of this potentially being just as bad in the long run.', '10 years smoker, 5 years vaper.

I believe we know the main chemicals in most vapes and how they affect people.  They have been around for around 10+ years so we definelty have some statistical data to rummage in.  We all know it's bad, but it most likely is not as bad as most would assume.  \n\nI'm more worried on salt nic juices getting more potent, and different flavors being used.    Regardless, I'm on the road of quiting as well but it's important to weigh information properly.  \n\nThis isn't even covering how vaping can affect each person differently.  If you have ADHD, I'd imagine this stuff is terrible.  If you have lung or heart issues, you will be quick to blame vapes.   It's all kinds hearsay but best practice is to stay informed and listen to your body.", 'The vaping subs were no help when i was trying to quit. It’s just a bunch of people making the most ridiculous excuses ever and there’s people in there believing it. \n\nThe amounts of salt nic are really ridiculous. I used to use 5% and it done a lot to me and maybe it’s true, it’s technically “better” than smoking but smoking never gave me the problems vaping did. Why i’m not sure. I believe it was because of the high nicotine concentration and all the disposables coming from god knows where. It’s crazy to me how people who have never used any kind of nicotine in their life will start out on 5% salt. My point is that it’s worse than everyone thinks, even tho it’s “better for you”.\n\nAlso, congratulations!', 'Yeah people there always say "no one has died from vaping". That\'s like saying no one has died from eating a twinkie. It\'s the long term build up that\'s going to hurt you. Nicotine alone is a vasoconstrictor, and will over time harden your arteries and lead to cardiovascular disease. And if you die from a heart attack, no ones going to say yup it was that last puff he took.', "I will say that the disposables are the biggest offenders when it comes to all of these issues. \nI'm not advocating for people to go out and vape, but I don't know anyone who had any breathing problems from freebase nicotine juice and a refillable system. Misinformation goes both ways, and I do believe vaping can be safer than smoking by a lot.", 'They give them out in the hospitals in the UK to help people quit smoking. I’ve seen tons of testimonials from ppl who switch to vape and they say their health improved so much. It’s confusing for sure.  I know for myself it was time to quit for my health.', 'The worst ones are where if someone says they are worried about unknown long term lung impact, there will be these bros saying they juul a pod a day, just got their xrays and their doctors told them they have the lungs of someone 5 years younger, their health checkups go amazing and what not. Just the worst ever. Forget nicotine addiction and its side effects or lungs for a second, my resting heart rate went down like 20 bpm within a month of quitting, and its going down bit by bit still.

When I stopped vaping a few months ago (thanks to this sub!), I realized that all I did was literally work, vape and exercise (my one redeeming hobby) for the last 8 years. I vaped in bed, at the movies, at my desk, on the couch, driving, on airplanes, hiking… there was never a time when I wasn’t vaping. Since I also don’t drink, I had to face how much of a crutch vaping was for me. I haven’t mastered the mental part of this recovery yet.

quitting is so worth it, i promise|*|['Completely agree on the insomnia thing.  I have battled insomnia for years and years. Of course, I was vaping in bed at bed time, vaping if I got up to go the bathroom, etc. I always suspected vaping had something to do with insomnia.

Much like the headache I got when I didn\'t drink coffee for 3 days.  I vaped for about 6 years pretty much all the time when I wasn\'t at work.  The hardest part is the psychological. It is the urge to reach for the vape out of habit during all the moments that you used to grab it, the thought in the back of the mind that says "I have a few minutes/hours free and by myself so I can relax and sit and vape", the driving in the car and feeling like you should be vaping. I used to finagle ways to go do things by myself so that I could vape in private. I could sit for hours watching some dull program on TV because I had my pacifier.  You know what I don\'t miss at all?  The fog on the inside of the car windshield and windows that you can\'t really clean off very well without straight vinegar.

My journey here ends. Thanks everyone for the tips!|*|['First, congratulations on your first season of freedom and healing, outstanding.  Not to hijack your celebration but the image you posted makes a factual claim that needs clarifying. \n\nThe assertion that it takes at least 3 months for "brain chemistry to return to normal" is from a [2016 Psych Central](https://psychcentral.com/news/2016/07/31/dopamine-function-returns-to-normal-3-months-after-quitting-smoking#1) article featuring [Rademacher 2006](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26803340/), a study that compared PET scans of 15 non-smokers to 30 smokers/quitters at **only two points in time**, at baseline (quitting day) and after 3 months of smoking cessation, in estimating the capacity of specific brain regions to synthesize dopamine.  To quote from the discussion portion of the study, "Follow-up scans performed 3 months after smoking cessation revealed that the initially lower K values significantly increased in the left ventral and right dorsal CN and became similar to that of nonsmokers in all regions of interest."\n\nThus, what the study cannot tell us is at what point during the prior 90 days was dopamine availability substantially similar to that of non-smokers.\n\nTo quote the finding from the most detailed dopamine pathway receptor "availability" study ever ([Cosgrove 2009](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2796827/)), while additional receptor downregulation is occurring, "there is **not a significant difference** between β2\\*-nAChR **availability** in smokers **at 2 and 4 weeks** of abstinence **compared to nonsmokers** ..."\n\nThe authors went on to state, "This study is also consistent with a previous study ([Mamede 2007](https://jnm.snmjournals.org/content/48/11/1829.long)) demonstrating that higher β2\\*-nAChR availability in recently abstinent tobacco smokers compared to nonsmokers is temporary. In the previous study in men, β2\\*-nAChR availability decreased to nonsmoker levels in some subjects **by 21 days** of abstinence. Specifically, compared to nonsmokers, smokers had significantly lower β2\\*-nAChR availability at 4 hr of abstinence, significantly higher β2\\*-nAChR availability at 10 days of abstinence, and similar β2\\*-nAChR availability at 21 days of abstinence. Additionally, they reported significantly lower β2\\*-nAChR availability at 21 days of abstinence compared to 10 days of abstinence."', 'Quit vaping in the apple App Store']|*|['First congratulation first season freedom healing outstanding Not hijack celebration image post make factual claim need clarify The assertion take least month brain chemistry return normal Psych Central URL article feature Rademacher URL study compare PET scan non smoker smoker quitter two point time baseline quit day month smoke cessation estimate capacity specific brain region synthesize dopamine To quote discussion portion study Follow scan perform month smoke cessation reveal initially low K value significantly increase left ventral right dorsal CN become similar nonsmoker region interest Thus study tell u point prior day dopamine availability substantially similar non smoker To quote find detailed dopamine pathway receptor availability study ever Cosgrove URL additional receptor downregulation occur significant difference β2 nAChR availability smoker week abstinence compare nonsmoker The author go state This study also consistent previous study Mamede URL demonstrate high β2 nAChR availability recently abstinent tobacco smoker compare nonsmoker temporary In previous study men β2 nAChR availability decrease nonsmoker level subject day abstinence Specifically compare nonsmoker smoker significantly low β2 nAChR availability hr abstinence significantly high β2 nAChR availability day abstinence similar β2 nAChR availability day abstinence Additionally report significantly low β2 nAChR availability day abstinence compare day abstinence', 'Quit vaping apple App Store']

It’s time|*|[]|*|[]
I quit nearly 5 months ago. Here’s a few things I don’t miss about vaping.|*|['I’ll add to it. \n\nI don’t miss having to drop $40+ for a new one every month or so (I used disposables). I don’t miss having to ask my parents for cash under the guise of “in case the restaurant I go to doesn’t accept card” to discreetly buy vapes. I don’t miss being dependent on something that brings no real benefit. I don’t miss the heavy feeling in my throat. I don’t miss the irritated swollen throat I started to get. I don’t miss having an addiction. I don’t miss needing to take hits every now and then. I don’t miss making it my entire personality. I don’t miss having to go upstairs away from spending time with my parents just to take hits in secret. I don’t miss buying counterfeit brands. I don’t miss faulty vapes.', 'As someone who never bought a vape aside from the occasional disposable, I REALLY don’t miss the feeling that I was only hanging out with my friends so I could hit their vape. \n\n\nIt was like every time I wanted to hang out with a good buddy of mine I had this secret ulterior motive. Just chilling with your friend unburdened by that addiction is so much better than the buzz, trust me.', "I was a secret user, too. My husband didn't know. He knew I was a smoker when we met, but pretty lightly so. I quit very easily and picked up vaping during covid lockdown. What a wasteful mistake, and I loathe hiding things from my spouse. It was a gross reality. Like you, I hated the sneaking and the bizarrely frequent escapes from family time", 'Well put! \n\nOne thing I really don’t miss is being hungry, but having to wait to get food, then chain ripping my vape so much that I’m not hungry by the time I get food, and as a result, I end up not eating and getting completely wired and jittery.', 'I agree with this. I consciously had to not hit my vape if I was going to a good restaurant because I actually wanted to have an appetite.', "I'm not going to lie I miss the buzz. Plus there is something therapeutic about vaping/smoking, I can't explain it. I also miss the flavors. My coworker is vaping in the office everyday and it smells like delicious granola bar.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlthough I will admit the biggest thing I hated most was getting anxious whenever I couldn't find my mod.", ' The buzz is great. Who would deny that? The problem is that it’s a maladaptive coping mechanism. You feel worse after you vape. You then have the option to sit through feeling bad or vape again to get to where you were originally. \n\n Everyone would use nicotine if it had no negatives but the negatives actually outweigh the positives.', 'I don’t miss the lack of appetite. When I used to vape it was impossible to eat and enjoy my food. I lost too much weight to this addiction. Been going strong since the start of the new year and I feel 10 times better.', "I don't miss trying to hit the vape in the work bathroom. I don't miss getting agitated at family parties cus I couldn't hit the vape. I don't miss the acid reflux vaping caused me. I have cravings but I tell myself the above whenever the cravings hit"]|*|['I add I miss drop new one every month I use disposable I miss ask parent cash guise case restaurant I go accept card discreetly buy vapes I miss dependent something brings real benefit I miss heavy feeling throat I miss irritated swollen throat I start get I miss addiction I miss need take hit every I miss make entire personality I miss go upstairs away spending time parent take hit secret I miss buy counterfeit brand I miss faulty vapes', 'As someone never buy vape aside occasional disposable I REALLY miss feeling I hang friend I could hit vape It like every time I want hang good buddy mine I secret ulterior motive Just chill friend unburden addiction much better buzz trust', 'I secret user My husband know He know I smoker meet pretty lightly I quit easily pick vaping covid lockdown What wasteful mistake I loathe hide thing spouse It gross reality Like I hat sneak bizarrely frequent escape family time', 'Well put One thing I really miss hungry wait get food chain rip vape much I hungry time I get food result I end eat get completely wire jittery', 'I agree I consciously hit vape I go good restaurant I actually want appetite', 'I go lie I miss buzz Plus something therapeutic vaping smoking I ca explain I also miss flavor My coworker vaping office everyday smell like delicious granola bar x200B Although I admit big thing I hat get anxious whenever I could find mod', 'The buzz great Who would deny The problem maladaptive cop mechanism You feel bad vape You option sit feeling bad vape get originally Everyone would use nicotine negative negative actually outweigh positive', 'I miss lack appetite When I use vape impossible eat enjoy food I lose much weight addiction Been go strong since start new year I feel time better', 'I miss try hit vape work bathroom I miss get agitate family party cu I could hit vape I miss acid reflux vaping cause I crave I tell whenever crave hit']
3 months free after JUULing a pod a day since 2015!|*|['Week 1\n\n\\-  absolute hell --  experienced low energy, was very irritable and anxious, was unproductive at work because of the frequent and intrusive thoughts about getting my next nicotine fix, felt a strange sensation in my chest whenever I experienced cravings, and had intense temptations to buy a new Juul every time I passed by a convenience store\n\nWeek 2\n\n\\- significantly more bearable compared to week 1 -- had much less intrusive thoughts about getting my next fix, felt my energy returning to normal, felt no more physical symptoms, and was less irritable and anxious. The only really difficult part about this week that I introduced to myself as a test was consuming alcohol without vaping, which I managed to do, and it became easier every time I tested myself afterwards\n\nWeek 3 -> Now\n\n\\- nothing very noteworthy... was pretty much cruising at this point as symptoms continued to lift. From this point, vaping became more and more of a thing of the past that I was disgusted of instead of a temptation every time I thought about it. And you\'ll go a day or days without thinking about vaping at all and realize, "Wait... I actually haven\'t been thinking about vaping at all. I use to think that was impossible!" \n\nA phrase inspired by Allen Carr\'s Easy Way to Stop Smoking that I kept repeating to myself throughout all of this was: "I only want to vape in order to remove the urge to vape, and in doing so I get to temporarily feel like a non-vaper.

Is vaping habit harmful?|*|['i will answer this, as i have pretty good knowledge on the matter and also invite criticism on my views as well...\n\nyes, it is a harmful habit. if you do not smoke cigs or vape... then dont start. there were studies showing that the flavors of vaping do kill lung cells, but smoke from actual cigarettes were much worse. in the tests, only something like 5 or 6% of lungs cells survived the tests from cigarettes, but in the vaping experiment, it was about 50 - 60% survival rate for a non menthol flavor, and about 25% survival rate for menthol flavors.\n\nthere was also a high increase in nitrogen or something that we exhale (not carbon dioxide but something else, maybe nitric oxide?) and it happens for every drag of a vape you take. i would have to watch the study on netflix again. the study, which was shown on netflix is called "ecigarettes - miracle or menace". i think everyone should watch it.\n\nwith all of this said, it is safe then smoking cigarettes in general, the royal college of physicians says it is 95% safer. but take that with a grain of salt.\n\ndo not start vaping just because it is cool because it does effect healthy lungs, but if you do start vaping, make sure you do not get anything from "black market" because you run a high risk of getting something that was not purified correctly, or something that was cut with a chemical that the people selling have no idea about in general.\n\nall in all, dont start vaping unless you already smoke, and if you do start vaping, then your better off weening yourself off the nic in lower and lowerr doses and finally quitting.\n\nand if your underage, then dont even think about starting.\n\nthat is one thing that bothers me is that underage kids get caught with liquor or alcohol and get penalties and fines, but if they get caught with cigs or vaping then they are a "victim" and face no punishment. this has to change. there needs to be as much punishment enforced for tobacco as their is alcohol. the place they buy it from should face consequences as well.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: i do vape myself, and is the reason i have followed this whole debacle since it started. i am an ex smoker of almost 25 years and i tell wvweyone, if you dont vape or smoke then dont start.\n\nTL;DR it is shown, atleats in short term, that vaping is SAFER than smoking, but not "SAFE". there are still underlying changes that happen to the body and people do not need to try to cover that up. educate yourself and inform others and realize it is not a good habit to have regardless.']|*|['answer pretty good knowledge matter also invite criticism view well yes harmful habit smoke cigs vape dont start study show flavor vaping kill lung cell smoke actual cigarette much bad test something like lung cell survive test cigarette vaping experiment survival rate non menthol flavor survival rate menthol flavor also high increase nitrogen something exhale carbon dioxide something else maybe nitric oxide happen every drag vape take would watch study netflix study show netflix call ecigarettes miracle menace think everyone watch say safe smoking cigarette general royal college physician say safer take grain salt start vaping cool effect healthy lung start vaping make sure get anything black market run high risk get something purify correctly something cut chemical people sell idea general dont start vaping unless already smoke start vaping good weening nic low lowerr do finally quit underage dont even think start one thing bother underage kid get catch liquor alcohol get penalty fine get catch cigs vaping victim face punishment change need much punishment enforce tobacco alcohol place buy face consequence well x200B EDIT vape reason follow whole debacle since start ex smoker almost year tell wvweyone dont vape smoke dont start TL DR show atleats short term vaping SAFER smoking SAFE still underlie change happen body people need try cover educate inform others realize good habit regardless']

VAPE IN USA|*|['Personally I think it isn’t beneficial. Coming from someone who smoked cigarettes before vaping, vaping has helped me so much. I also find it very unfair because I never have vaped something with THC in it (that is what people are saying is causing the vaping related illnesses)  personally I’ve just been buying vape pods for the past year from a local vape shop or my local gas station. It has helped me so much. I feel like over the past year while I was vaping instead of smoking I was so much of a happier person in general. I didn’t have to worry about the smell of cigarettes and in my mind I felt like I was being healthier. With all this going on I feel like I am going to have to go back to smoking cigarettes again and that defeats the reason vapes were invented in the first place....', "Here in Michigan (state in USA) our governor has banned all flavored vape liquids. it's ridiculous and an overreaction to 6 deaths across the US that have been caused by vaping black market THC cartridges.

Nice Salt in Sub-Ohm|*|['the main reason, atleast for me is, you will lose lung capacity. just because you can vape 50mg in a sub ohm tank doesnt mean you shoudl just like in your analogy with the sports car. you can drive fast everywhere you go but you are at a much higher risk of wrecking.  \n\n\nnicotine is not a natural human chemical. it inflames tissue, it is actually labeled as a poison because if you take it in to high of concentrated doses it can cause death, but meh anything is liek that tbh. moderation is key.  \n\n\nif i were you though,  if you were to vape nic salt in a sub ohm tank, i would personally drop it down to 18-24 mg. because with 50mg even i over do it on a mtl device and have lost a little lung capacity. when i talk about lung capacity i mean the amount of oxegen your lungs is able to take in, not the full amount of air you inhale. when you dont have as much oxegen going to yoru body you will cramp and be light headed, especially when you try to stand up or do anything strenuous.   \n\n\nso like i say, i would go down to atleast 18-24mg nic salt if you were to try to vape it on a dl tank. another good idea is to buy juice like smash mouth by humble. they offer this flavor in high strength nic salt and in regular juice. if anything i would take like 3mg and spike it with some nic salts. fill up the tank like 2/3 the way with 3mg then top it off with 35-40mg salts.\n\n&#x200B;\n\neither way, the first thing you should always care for is the health of yourself. if you are not worried about your health then i am not sure why your asking for advice in the first place. good luck and happy vaping!']|*|['main reason atleast lose lung capacity vape mg sub ohm tank doesnt mean shoudl like analogy sport car drive fast everywhere go much high risk wreck nicotine natural human chemical inflames tissue actually label poison take high concentrate do cause death meh anything liek tbh moderation key though vape nic salt sub ohm tank would personally drop mg mg even mtl device lose little lung capacity talk lung capacity mean amount oxegen lungs able take full amount air inhale dont much oxegen go yoru body cramp light head especially try stand anything strenuous like say would go atleast mg nic salt try vape dl tank another good idea buy juice like smash mouth humble offer flavor high strength nic salt regular juice anything would take like mg spike nic salt fill tank like way mg top mg salt x200B either way first thing always care health worried health sure ask advice first place good luck happy vaping']

Thoughts and prayers are welcome|*|['I stopped 24 days ago now. A few tips on how I did it was basically just go to 3% pods starting now and rip the fuck out of them. It doesn’t matter how much u smoke of them just swap, then taper off until you’re smoking the same level you were smoking 5% at. I.E you smoked one 5% pod a day, smoke 3% until you only smoke one or less pods a day. Then try quitting from there, as someone who failed 4 times that’s what helped me. I understand 24 days isn’t the longest but it’s the longest I’ve ever went by far. Used to smoke 1+ pod of 5% a day.', 'Congrats on quitting. This is what I am currently trying. Did you use anything else when you stopped smoking the 3% all together?', 'Talk to your doc if you want to stop with help. You aren’t the first person to get addicted to something and you aren’t alone if you feel kind of hopeless. Don’t beat yourself up for just living life and having “an issue”. We all have issues and we all have to deal with them. \n\nJuul/ vaping is a lot better than smoking cigarettes or inhaling anything thats burn, including cannabis (joints/ bongs etc). \n\nI for one love my Juul and won’t be quitting anytime soon, as theres a good chance I’ll pick up smoking again.\n\nEdit: when talking about smoking cannabis, I’m referring to tar and build up in your lungs from smoke byproduct.', 'Yeah look when I used to smoke darts and run though bongs every day it completely shafted my throat and lungs, and that went on for 6-8 months tops.

In terms of lung capacity, general feeling of lung health (coughing, shortness of breath, struggles with breathing or sinus issues, and general pain), and my laziness / willingness to exercise and for longer amount of times, juul really does hurt me. \n\nBeing a heavy cannabis smoker I find my lungs work best when all I do is smoke bud, I notice extremely negatives effects after even a few days of juuling and now that I am a daily vaper (is that a word) I find it getting soo much worse. When I’m Smoking bud and juuling / doing both daily, I find my lungs, while they have major issues, still work a hell of a lot better than when I’m only juuling and haven’t smoked cannabis in a long while.\n\n\nJuuling will definitely get you off of cigarettes and is honesty a lot better for your health than any other forms of smokeable or non smokeable tobacco (except maybe nicotine gum ? But that doesn’t count for shit) \n\nSo if you have a cigarette or cigar problem juuling might be a good thing for you and can definitely help you while letting you feel your lungs improving but it is still just trading one addiction for another and honestly a nicotine addiction through these 5% pods is harder to quit than cigarettes can be.', "I couldn't take the salt nic, my fucking lungs were constantly tight an I seemed short of breath.

The struggle|*|[]|*|[]
PSA|*|['They really need to improve the Juul pod\'s design. It should not leak nor give you a bad time considering that they\'re one of the leading ecig in the market right now.\n\nHere\'s some Juul pod saving tips I got.\n\nI asked a Juul kiosk personnel just the other day on how to prevent Juul leaks. She told me that you need to keep it up right when storing it. The mouthpiece on top while the colored cap at the bottom. Never put it upside down as the juice will try to escape through the rubber gasket.\n\nI followed her tip and my Juul pods lasted me 2.5 days without leaks.\n\nYou might notice that everytime you wake up, you might see juices splattered all over your pod (happens mostly when the pod is already half-way). You may think these are leaks but in reality these are just the absorbed spit backs that came down from the mouthpiece\'s cotton. Gravity pulled it down.\n\nIf there are juices that leaks into your mouth, roll down a pair of small tissue papers and make paper sticks out of it. Then insert it through the mouthpiece. This will absorb excess juices that were stucked on top of the rubber gasket.\n\nDo not chain vape. Try to give it a few shakes every after 3 to 5 puffs. You may want to check the air bubbles. If you see a "W" shape air bubbles and if the middle part of that "W" looks connected to the mouthpiece. Shake and rotate the pod a bit until the bubble flattens down. That middle part of the airbubble tends to escape through the air hole and might eventually pull the juice inside the pod whenever you puff and it will eventually deposit a lot of excess juice in the mouthpiece.\n\nHope this helps.', "Ave you called your local representatives and voiced your concern with the ban?\n\nOn Sunday, September 15, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that he would be directing the state’s Public Health and Health Planning Council to hold an emergency meeting to “ban e-cigarette flavors.”\n\nThis meeting is scheduled for\n\nSeptember 17, 2019\n2:30 PM\nAt the following locations:\n\n---\n\nNewYork State Department of Health Offices\n90 Church Street\n4th Floor, RoomsPSC Board Room\nNew York City (Main meeting site)\nNew York State Department of Health Offices\n584 Delaware Avenue\n2nd Floor VideoConference Room\nBuffalo, NY 14202\nNew York State Department of Health Offices\nTriangle Building\n335 East Main Street\n1st Floor Conference Room\nRochester, NY 14604\nNew York State Department of Health Offices\nCorning Tower\n14th Floor, Conference Room #1 (CR #1)\nAlbany, NY\n\nThe Public Health and Health Planning Council's Codes, Regulation and Legislation Committee will convene a Special Meeting at 2:30 p.m. immediately followed by a Special meeting of the Full Council.\n\nIf you are able to attend this meeting at any of these locations, calling ahead is recommended in order to speed up passing through security.

Not because I think vaping is killing people, which I would assume most of us here can agree is bunk science, and more than likely a scapegoat for something bigger. But, rather because I came to the conclusion that I don't actually know why I still vape. I got myself up to nearly 2 pods per day after a year of consistent use, and that's made it harder for me to pay my bills. I have gone without pods a couple of times since then, and it wasn't until the last time that happened that I actually felt like a junkie. For some, nicotine addiction is nothing.

When juul is life 😂|*|[]|*|[]
a message from tyler, the creator|*|['I read that some of these vape related deaths are from cannabis vape pens. Are these the same incidents? I could see a kid not wanting their parents knowing they smoked pot and blaming it on juul.', 'In THC cartridges (the main thing reported vaped from the patients that are currently sick in the hospital) should only contain distillate and terpenoids which are two normal things to find in THC cartridges. People have been adding Vitamin E acetate because it thickens the oil and the thicker the oil the better people think it is. And when vitamin E acetate is vaporized it turns back into a grease in your lungs causing these effects. But what doesn’t make sense is how a very small amount of people reported this happening after vaping nicotine which shouldn’t ever contain vitamin E. So maybe you’re right about kids not wanting their parents knowing it was THC so they blamed it on nicotine and all of these hospitalized patients are from THC carts', 'https://www.bloomberg.com/amp/news/articles/2019-09-05/vaping-lung-illness-tied-to-cannabis-products-new-york-says\n\nSeems to be stemmed from vitamin E acetate in weed pens. Both legal and non. But you know Juul is going to have a microscope on them', 'Whats y’alls opinion on all the controversy coming out about lung problems from juul? I’ve been smoking it for over a month now and feel waaaaaay less effects on my lungs when I play basketball or skate than when I smoked cigarettes and I would barley smoke cigs. Like maybe a pack in 2-3 weeks.', 'Try smoking them for 3 years like me..actaully dont i now have shit lungs', 'Every one will have different reactions to how chemicals are consumed with their body’s. Take everything with a grain of salt and use it as a steeping stone vs going cold turkey from smoking.', 'this is all obviously some trend. all the diseases are linked to weed vapes', "I understand that all these cases come from the vitamin e acetate and fake black market carts/pods, but why are they all coming out right now?  Fake carts and pods have been around for years, and there really hasn't been too much buzz around them, and suddenly there are 450 lung illnesses related to vaping.", 'So, there is little fact out there and a whole lot of misinformation out there. I\'m gonna possibly add to both of these areas.  :D  \n\n\nIt\'s pretty evident, thus far, that Juul is not the perpetrator in these lung illnesses and deaths. But, there is more to this story...Juul is owned by Altria Group, who makes Marlboro. Altria had valued Juul at around 30+ billion dollars in 2018, then invested over 12 billion, now owning 35% stake of the company.   \n\n\nFDA has been full attack mode on e-ciggs since 2017. They have some bullshit numbers showing increase of youth vaping by upwards of 80% etc...pushing most of the blame on Juul, since they control around 60-75% of the non-traditional smokers market. Just to be clear, FDA wanted to ban e-ciggs, but not for safety or health concerns. They started with talking banning menthol cigg flavors, in general (both vape and cigg), including Juul in this attack. At this point, vaping had already exploded.   \n\n\nNow my conspiracy theory (using economic and political theory);   \n\n\nThe FDA alone couldn\'t get the support they needed to push a ban these type of carts. \n\nJuul/Altira/FDA get in cahoots. Juul bows happily to all FDA demands. This "fruity flavor" ban ELIMINATES ALL COMPETITORS that can\'t afford to withstand such a ban. A multi-billion company on the other hand, can stand against such losses, for the short-term. Just to throw it out there, this is usually how monopolies are created, only with help from the state. Monopolies are RARELY created organically and almost always are created with assistance of the government.    \n\n\nNow, this strange epidemic of illicit THC carts comes out of the woodwork. The reason this is so strange is because you would think, unless it was a massive supplier of tainted carts (perhaps an online operation), these tainted cart stories would have been more specific to areas they were created. In other words, lets say 5 illicit cart dealers decide to start spiking their oils with Vitamin E oil, in Los Angeles. It\'s hard to believe that in just the past 6 months, hundreds of illicit cart dealers decide to do the same thing, throughout the nation.  Anyhow, since the FDA could not get the support to push through a ban for the "fruity flavor" ban, this was the cherry on the cake. FDA bounces on it. Hysteria proceeds. Push the ban.', 'Juul can kick back and watch small businesses close up shop. I wouldn\'t be surprised if the FDA continue to push bans onto other non-traditional smoking devices, beyond e-ciggs, including e-juices for cart style vape devices. \n\nThen when all the "science is settled", and they find the juices and whatnot to be safer than smoking, again, Juul will be right back on the market and stronger than ever. They will most likely have a larger stake on the market, when they return, with new products and everything. How conveinent.   \n\n\n@BadVladTheMadLad what do you think?', 'juuls aint for kiddos bruh, its for us who formerly smokes 2 packs a day']|*|['I read vape relate death cannabis vape pen Are incident I could see kid want parent know smoke pot blame juul', 'In THC cartridge main thing report vaped patient currently sick hospital contain distillate terpenoids two normal thing find THC cartridge People add Vitamin E acetate thickens oil thicker oil better people think And vitamin E acetate vaporize turn back grease lung cause effect But make sense small amount people report happen vaping nicotine ever contain vitamin E So maybe right kid want parent know THC blame nicotine hospitalize patient THC cart', 'URL Seems stem vitamin E acetate weed pen Both legal non But know Juul go microscope', 'Whats alls opinion controversy come lung problem juul I smoke month feel waaaaaay le effect lung I play basketball skate I smoke cigarette I would barley smoke cigs Like maybe pack week', 'Try smoke year like actaully dont shit lung', 'Every one different reaction chemical consume body s Take everything grain salt use steep stone v go cold turkey smoking', 'obviously trend disease link weed vapes', 'I understand case come vitamin e acetate fake black market cart pod come right Fake cart pod around year really much buzz around suddenly lung illness related vaping', 'So little fact whole lot misinformation I gon na possibly add area D It pretty evident thus far Juul perpetrator lung illnesses death But story Juul Altria Group make Marlboro Altria value Juul around billion dollar invest billion stake company FDA full attack mode e ciggs since They bullshit number show increase youth vaping upwards etc push blame Juul since control around non traditional smoker market Just clear FDA want ban e ciggs safety health concern They start talk ban menthol cigg flavor general vape cigg include Juul attack At point vaping already explode Now conspiracy theory use economic political theory The FDA alone could get support need push ban type cart Juul Altira FDA get cahoot Juul bow happily FDA demand This fruity flavor ban ELIMINATES ALL COMPETITORS ca afford withstand ban A multi billion company hand stand loss short term Just throw usually monopoly create help state Monopolies RARELY create organically almost always create assistance government Now strange epidemic illicit THC cart come woodwork The reason strange would think unless massive supplier taint cart perhaps online operation taint cart story would specific area create In word let say illicit cart dealer decide start spike oil Vitamin E oil Los Angeles It hard believe past month hundred illicit cart dealer decide thing throughout nation Anyhow since FDA could get support push ban fruity flavor ban cherry cake FDA bounce Hysteria proceeds Push ban', 'Juul kick back watch small business close shop I would surprise FDA continue push ban onto non traditional smoking device beyond e ciggs include e juice cart style vape device Then science settle find juice whatnot safe smoking Juul right back market strong ever They likely large stake market return new product everything How conveinent BadVladTheMadLad think', 'juuls aint kiddos bruh u formerly smoke pack day']
