A few weeks later, he just stopped even having that one cigarette.\n\nI went to that shop and they were awesome. It is run by a guy who isn't interested in selling big fancy complicated rigs, he just kept it simple and directed the hobbyists to a different shop, but made his business for people who just want to stop smoking.\n\nIt has been probably three years since I touched a cigarette.

Immediately I stopped smoking actual cigarettes. Within 6 months I was chewing gum. Now 2 years later I haven't had a single cigarette since.\n\nFor me, nothing worked for over two decades until I started using e-cigarettes. This quite likely saved my life - just the new years before I finally switched I was having an enormous amount of health symptoms - shortness of breath, throbbing head aches, tingling and burning sensations in my extremities. I even passed out briefly at our new years party with a bout of light headedness. \n\nNow, it almost goes without saying, but since making the switch all of those symptoms have disappeared. Not only that but my health has made a huge rebound - I've lost weight since then and I've been able to go to the gym and work out, which was impossible before with my wheezing and gasping and massive blood pressure problems. \n\nIt's impossible for me to overstate this - I am so incredibly thankful that my wife convinced me to give e-cigarettes a try. I don't even want to imagine what would have happened to me if I hadn't made the switch and I heartily recommend it to anyone reading this thread and wishing that they could quit smoking but had failed multiple times like I did.

If you maintain normal smoker\'s etiquette with the vape, you will have no problems. Abuse of that etiquette by douchenozzles in flame shirts is how this lovely advancement got a bad rap. \n\nThis is the one thing I, a middle aged man, am angry at millennials about. Why could you, of all people, not be cool. Why. And stop making Youtube videos about it. Only the dorkiest of Cigar Aficionados made a hobby about tobacco. That was one of the things that made it cool. Nobody actually nerded out about it. You just smoked, all casual. It looked poetic between a lady\'s fingers, and was associated with suffrage. Edward Munch made a point to paint himself [holding one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iu2L7oA9QRg).\n\nDrawbacks. The vape is not cool. It just isn\'t. It doesn\'t LOOK cool. I once had somebody laugh at me for "sucking on the robot dick". Ain\'t nothing free. The main benefit of the cigarette is its slender profile, its poetry, it\'s association with fire. One can talk about breathing the air of hell. \n\nBut. Smoking is not cool. The kids don\'t smoke, these days. It\'s passe. Pretty girls (and lovely boys) didn\'t smoke much before, and now they really, really don\'t. The vape will not make your kiss taste like an ashtray. So even though the vape is a bit lame, well, smoking is even more lame. Those who are inclined to live and let live about vaping, despite its weird rep, will have real and understandable reasons to despise you if you continue to smoke. As I say, keep your smokers etiquette intact, and non-vapers will only comment on how lovely you make their world smell.\n\nIf not for some a-holes trying really hard to be fedora cunts and spoil it, the vape conjures the dream of smoking, rooms full of artful fog, but when the non-smoker walks into this fog, it smells like cherries, or butterscotch, not grimy tobacco. Frankly, you will not enjoy the flavors as much as they will, as scents. \n\nI cannot recommend the practice enough. Vape. Vape while you still can. \n\nAh. One last drawback. As a smoker, you were used to a cigarette being a cigarette forever, with few changes. But the vape is an electronic device made mostly in China. If somebody could recommend an American manufactured vape, please do, for some will care a lot about that. Like all electronics, vapes are constantly updated. New models and designs are forever being pushed out. The best of the designs stick around for a while, but you will be annoyed by your need to update. However, buy a popular model, and you will be satisfied for quite some time.\n\nAs per DONG_MAGNUM (ffs Reddit) posted, your days are sort of numbered here. They will soon regulate vapes into submission, and in a year, I don\'t know if my advice will be worthwhile. But for now, today, January 1st, there has never been a better time to buy a vape and ditch the smokes. I still fire up a cigarette here and there. I am never happy with it. You too can own this look of satisfaction.\n\nI cannot recommend vaping enough.

I probably tried every other avenue out there, I would quit for a week or month and then relapse and fall down the hill harder every time. First stint with vaping was with one of those cheap little stick mods which I hated. No flavor or throat hit to speak of. I went back to smoking after about 3 days of use for about two years. Got my first sub-ohm around 2013-2014. loved it so at the start, the thing was absolutely amazing. A throat hit to rival a cigarette, I was in awe. But that faded, the flavors I was picking were awful, the upkeep because of the fact that I worked in a production factory was too much, and it started to taste nasty every once in a while. Went back to smoking after about 7 months of vaping. \n\nAfter a few weeks of chain smoking, I noticed a change, a dramatic change. Thing's that tasted delicious before were tasting plain, I couldn't smell anything, I was wheezing, finding it much harder to fall asleep, and there was this noticeable odor around me. I know all of this is common knowledge side effect of smoking, but the fact that the change was so apparent really shocked me. I went back to the vape store and spend probably 200$ on the best vape I could possibly think of and talked for an extended period of time about flavors, that was back in February of 2015. I have not had a cigarette in almost 2 years. feels good man.\n\nMy dad recently started vaping as well, bought one of the little stick mods like I told him not too. Much more successful than me with it but he teetered every week and bought a pack when he was drinking or golfing.

It costs about 120$ for the complete package, I personally started saving money after the second month of vaping. Talk with the guys at the desk about flavors, in my experience, they have been extremely helpful in finding a wide range of flavors that I really enjoy.

It hit /r/all and reminded me that I need to kick this shit for good.", "In my opinion its the only way to quit for a very high percentage of people. Compounding that, other methods can have pretty bad side effects. I was a BIG fucking tobacco user. I regularly used pipes, cigars, RYO, unfiltered, dip, chew, spliffs, dokha, hookah, snus, pouches. I was a tobacco enthusiast. 1+ packs a day. Lots of money. Lots of tar. I've been vaping since before it became a thing. When vapes actually got good and I actually for real stopped using tobacco it was life changing. Sometimes I miss a real cigarette but man if I smoke one now its usually pretty fucking gross. Nothing really beats a dip either when you are working in the shop or on the lawn. I don't even dare try to roll one of my fine fine RYO cigs, rizla papers, amsterdam shag, swan filters. But ecig is pretty god damn good and I've got a gallon of liquid that cost me almost nothing and my gums arent fucked up, I don't smell like shit, I can breathe, I can smell, I can ascend stairs, I don't have the threat of heart and lung disease looming all over me, my clothes don't smell like shit, my car doesn't smell like shit, no ashes, no butts, no rolling down the window in the car even, no going outside in the cold, no yellow walls in my apartment, no burns on my couch, no hole in my wallet. \n\nMy biggest advice is get a good liquid and a good vape from the start. I started out when vapes and liquids were both pretty shitty and then in the middle years when shit could get expensive and frustrating I vaped and smoked or dipped. Thats my second biggest advice, get your good vape AND DO NOT SMOKE. I have one friend that vaped and quit and two friends that do both. I seriously can't even stand a cigarette now especially when I got some big hit of chocolately yummy cool vapor right in my pocket. \n\nAs far as cessation I've only ever seen two people quit that I personally know. My dad did every fucking method; inhalers, gum for YEARS, patches, welbutrin, pouches for years (all have side effects worse than vaping AFAIK). After like 12 fucking years supposedly he quit. The other person I know got a shitty ecig and weened himself down by milligram and quit easy. Literally of all the people I personally know thats it. But then theres me, I love nicotine, I love the oral fixation, I love it with a beer, I love it in the car, and I got three batteries and a big fuckin dripper ready to bang bang. \n\nI started with those weird old clear things marketed on the internet that vaped who knows what. It faded out because it sucked then Blu came out. Tried that bullshit it was okay, or so I thought, kept smoking. Vaped on and off for a few years, mostly with a pen style and an old school 306 dripper. Then slightly more quality mods and more powerful tanks started coming out but they were still kinda frustrating and shitty and expensive. When affordable mods and sub-ohm tanks hit the market I entered the golden age. My first decent ecig when I finally quit was an internal battery 35w mod with a 1ohm coil in a tank. Cost me about $75, and it was kind of a piece of shit. Over the years 32mg, to 24mg, to 18mg, usually $13-$20 a bottle. I currently vape a 3 18650 battery mod that holds up to all kinds of abuse and pumps 200 fuckin watts and I got big fat nichrome juggernaut dual coils totalling .2ohms in a Doge and I'm assblastin 100%VG 3mg clouds that cost me THIRTY FIVE CENTS a bottle. \n\nIf you wanna quit go get a decent $20-$30 mod, sub ohm tank, and play around in the 8mg-14mg range until you don't crave. Wheen yourself off down to 0mg and work on getting rid of the fixation. Keep a bottle of 2mg around for emergencies. If you're like me, just start out with a nice $40-$60 mod - a nice tank - and a nice dripper - fuck the drama - play around in the 4mh-8mg range until you can get down to <3mg, and puff the fuck away. Either way your smell will improve, your breath will improve, if you smoke weed your ass gonna be coughin and takin huge hits and gettin hella high and the weed gonna taste hecka good, you gonna be goin up stairs like a motherfucker. \n\nP.S.

You need to consider the device, the nicotine concentration and a lot of small details like supplies and backups.\n\nYou win a world of flavors, a myriad of devices.

It works very well for most people. I'm probably in a minority. During the time I was vaping, cigs made me gag and I hated them. Vaping is delicious and I miss it. But goddamn, it is inconvenient for me as someone who liked to drip and was a chain vaper. It doesnt have to be like that for you thought. get a tank and a simple mod and try it out. Good luck. ", 'Love vaping. Been 4 years smoke free!', "30 year old here. After thirteen years I've been smoke free since June of this year. Enough was enough. My buddy actually set me up with my first mod and a few coils and different juices after he had quit. At the moment it's in my hetero life mate's head about being that time to give up the cigarettes. I keep telling him that I'd help him out with what he wants and when he wants to do it. Just want to pay it forward. Good luck to all trying to give it up for good!", "Just wanna say this is a great community with awesome people. If you are prone to picking up hobbies this is an amazing one to have. I was one of those people once upon a time that thought vaping was absolutely ridiculous. I always said I'd rather quit smoking all together instead of picking up vaping. However, with an addictive personality it was extremely difficult for me to quit. When I started to research more about vaping I was convinced from all of the Reddit knowledge and gave it a go. I won't lie it took me a few tries to find a set up that worked for me to give up cigarettes all together but I finally found it. Currently on the Ijoy RDTA box. I first started with some Kangetech pens. Moved into an IPV400, migrated to a Wismec Reuleaux 200s. So I did spend some money in those first couple months but after research and playing around I have now found a constructive hobby in building and have quit smoking. After smoking for 9 years I am 100% done with cigarettes. I have been vaping for 5 months now and used to smoke minimum one pack per day. I have saved over $1000 dollars not buying cigarettes. Please give it a try. Start with an expensive set up and see where it goes. Even cutting back does a world of good. \n\nI hope everyone that sets a resolution is strong enough to hit their goal and if you don't succeed the first time around don't become discouraged. As stated it took me a few attempts. Then pens didn't really do it for me but it was a fantastic starting point! Everyone is different and it might work for you. \n\nGood luck and vape on!", 'How safe are the pens ?

Turns out it was because I had tried to go with a cheap-stick style vape, some flimsy $30 gadget.  It wasn't until I dropped $70 on a quality box-mod with adjustable voltage that it finally felt like not just a replacement for smoking, but an improvement.  To those who are interested in trying this, my advice is to be willing to eat the heavier up-front cost of a good device.\n\nBecause once you do...

Had no idea that this subreddit existed. I started vaping not too long ago as a primary hookah/shisha smoker.\n\nSo I guess if any of you visiting here were wondering about this, the electronic cigarette is also more ideal than a hookah/shisha. On average shisha contains around 10-15 mg of nicotine. When I started with the vape, I bought e-juices that are 3mg nicotine and found it very satisfying. The good thing is that it effectively cut down my nicotine intake. Overall it's less work and clean up too. I still love shisha but the vape is definitely more ideal. Also I believe you at least cut out the toxins that come from the coal and such.\n\nI started out with the joyetech starter, the one posted in the sidebar.

Bought a crappy setup from the equivalent of a mall kiosk, it broke after a week. Back to the fags. Daughter was born. HAVE to quit smoking. Came to /r/ecr, listened in on /u/chris2vaped doing a QnA where people were asking the questions that I wanted to ask. Invested $60 in a decent setup and here I am now. I relapsed once - on day 11 I had to have a cigarette. 2 puffs later it tasted so vile I tossed it and haven't had any since. Vaping isn't a magic bullet, you do still need a little willpower for the first couple of weeks - your body's addicted to all the other crap that's in cigarettes beside the nicotine and it takes a little while for that to fade out - but since then it's been plain sailing. Dropped the nicotine level from 18mg to 1mg, and hopefully I'll quit vaping soon too. \n\nDon't be afraid to ask anyone here questions. There's no such thing as a silly one.

Those results will encourage you to keep going, and before you know it, you\'ve gone weeks without a cigarette. \n\nThere\'s a lot of quit smoking apps out there that can help you count the days, and counting days can be important when you\'re quitting. I didn\'t stop counting days until it had been well over a year. I opened that app several times a day for weeks.

Personally, I did not. I kept my pack of cigarettes, because i knew the kind of anxiety that not having access to cigarettes caused me. I kept my last pack, and it was in plain sight in my bedroom. It was there if I absolutely needed it. Knowing that I could have a cigarette whenever I wanted actually helped me. When that craving hit me, I huffed on that goddamn vape like a fiend. But that craving would subside after 10 minutes of vaping hard, and I would completely forget about the cigarette. I tried one cigarette after a month of not having any - my cravings for them had subsided, I just wanted to see what I would think of them at that point. It was terrible, and I didn\'t finish it. I took a couple drags and put it out. It tasted bad, felt bad, and smelled bad. At that point, I knew I had won.\n\nWhen you first start, you might not know how long to vape in one go because it doesn\'t have the predestined time that a lit cigarette does. Don\'t be worried that you don\'t know when to stop. Just keep going until you feel like you\'ve had enough. Vape for an hour straight if you are having cravings. Just keep going until you\'ve had enough. You\'ll figure it out. \n\nSo I recommend finding a vaping solution that works for YOU... and at this point, it\'s not hard to find one!

They sell decent juice at really good prices. Before I started making my own this was the place I would go to buy the bulk of my juice. (I would recommend circus bear) As an added bonus they almost always throw in a free bottle or two, just because they are cool like that. 😎\n\n[Mt Baker Vapor](https://www.mtbakervapor.com/) \n\nThese guys sell fantastic juice at fantastic prices. They also sell flavorings which are very easy use if you are just staring DIY. I would personally recomend Moo Juice, its a very nice strawberry milk flavor.\n\n**To buy hardware:**\n\nIf you are juuuust starting out I would highly recommend an ego pen. They are what I started on and they both work and are extremely affordable. Right now [Vapes.com](https://www.vapes.com/shop/ego-ce4-vape-starter-kit-limited-time-offer/) is having a sale on a starter kit for $6. (Most places charge $20 or more for a pen, just to prey on the newcomers) \n\nFor a good starting device a step or two up from a pen I would recommend an [iStick 30w](https://www.misthub.com/product/eleaf-istick-30w-box-mod/). They currently are going for $26, but if you want to be able to use it you will need an atomizer. A good atomizer to start with is the [Aspire Atlantis 2](https://buyvaporizerpen.com/accessories/aspire-atlantis-2-sub-ohm?gclid=CjwKEAiAwZO0BRDvxs_1w-qFnhkSJABo10gge-z0mTnQAJkGTpWq6EaovqP5fRMtAp5GTEHC5nOvOxoCevHw_wcB). These are going for about 30 and are an extremely reliable, easy to use tank that holds around 3ml of juice. \n\nAnother fantastic starting device is the [Innokin Endura](http://www.myvaporstore.com/Innokin-Endura-T18-Starter-Kit-p/ink-end10.htm). This is a sleeker device that will only run you 30$ without having to buy a seperate atomizer. It features a 3ml tank and a 1000 mAh battery, which should last you a decent amount of time.\n\n**Choosing a nicotine strength:**\n\nMake sure to understand nicotine strength when ordering juice. (Keep in mind that in higher nicotine contents flavor will be harder to taste just due to the throat hit)\n\n0mg: No nicotine at all\n\n3mg: extremely light and almost unnoticeable in a pen, this works best with dripping atomizers or powerful tank setups.\n\n6mg: Pretty much the standard strength. Extremely light in a pen but not to strong in a dripper.\n\n12mg: Intermediate strength. Works decent in a pen and is bitey in dripper or tank. If you are quitting smoking I would recommend this if you are getting the iStick/atlantis setup I recommended earlier or something similar.\n\n18mg: Strong. Very bitey in a tank but can still be a decent choice depending on how long you have been smoking. This is pretty much the perfect strength in a pen.\n\n22+mg: Extremely strong. This is so strong to the point where it will mute the flavor of the juice due to its intense throat hit. Don't even bother running this in a tank or dripper unless you only plan on puffing. Mimics smoking really well in a pen though.\n\n30+mg: Anything this strong is either in a crappy gas station eCig or is nicotine base used in DIY eLiquid. Don't buy anything this strong unless you know what you are doing.\n\n**Understanding Vg/Pg ratios**\n\nMost juice is made with a vg/pg base.\n\nVg, or vegetable glycerin,  is a very viscous liquid that is metabolized into sugar. Due to its dense and viscous nature it creates a lot more vapor than pg. Pg, or propylene glycol, is a very runny substance that is found in many foods to preserve them and in asthma inhalers. It creates for more of a throat hit and carries flavor better. If you are running a pen I would recommend getting juice with a higher pg content than vg to taste the flavor a bit better, and if you are running a bigger device it would be better to get a higher vg content juice for less of a throat hit and more vapor production. \n\nIf these numbers are a bit confusing to you don't worry, most juice vendors have a way for you to select your nicotine strength and vg/pg ratio.\n\nTo recap, here is a helpful [infographic](http://imgur.com/a/THpUQ) that explains the parts of an e-cig and the ingredients to e-juice.\n\nWith all that being said I hope you have a wonderful mew year and vape on!\n", 'This is a good write up.\n\nHowever, I definitely think that the Atlantis is not that great of a starter tank by any means.

My cervical spine has straightened and is now bowing in the wrong direction. One disc has tri-compartmental stenosis which means the nerves are being compressed in 3 directions. I am the type of case that you hear about when someone just wakes up paralyzed. That risk is real for me. I need surgery. No doctor would touch me before because I smoked. The best case scenario is 20% fusion healing with a smoker. It goes up to almost 50% now that I quit. I need a tri-level fusion and that is a hugely complicated surgery with an obviously high failure rate. I do not have the Science to prove this only the various Surgeons who fired me because I smoked. They refused to do the surgery even though they told me I have no choice but to have it. I even had a Healer/Physical Therapist/Chiropractor refuse to take my case because he said he didn't think he should try to help me heal when I am undoing all of it by smoking. This man said this to me five years ago. It didn't even phase me other then crying my eyes out from the pain. I just kept on smoking. I was in real danger of death or a horrific quality of life but didn't even try to quit. Vaping has saved my life, very literally saved my life.\n\nIf anyone needs someone to talk to or recommendations on setups or even a freebie pack of juice, shoot me a PM. I have some flavors from Mt.

It's a leaf from a tree that grows in Southeast Asia. Surprisingly this treatment evolved in such a way that it contains chemicals in it that act like opiods found in poppy plants but work completely differently. Swallowing between 3-7 grams of this powdered leaf gives you a small boost in energy, mood enhancement and a bit of euphoria but most importantly pain relief. Also it is very inexpensive and legal. It is only marginally addictive and the withdrawal symptoms are mild at best. Speaking of withdrawal kratom can be used to severely dull withdrawal symptoms from a serious pain pill/heroin addiction. If you're interested check out /r/kratom or /r/kratomkorner . If you've been dealing with chronic pain for a long time and don't want to be forced to take hardcover pain pills it's worth looking into.

No, that\'s not a very heavy amount, and I never really felt "addicted" to it. A year later, I saw my friend using a vape. So I went out and bought one, because I could use it inside, not to quit smoking. For a while, that\'s what I did. I was using both of them. And eventually, I just decided that I liked vaping better.

And rechargeable.\n\nThis is just to let you try it without completely wasting your money. It has a good vapor production. Being able to buy it is instant gratification - let's admit it, as smokers we are (I was) about that. \n\nIf you smoke less than a pack a day, the Blu may work for you just fine.\n\nIf you are okay with waiting, then I would suggest an eGo kit from an online retailer. You can price check these but I find that www.madvapes.com is very reasonable and fast with shipping.\n\nIt's a weird world out there with ohms and amps and nicotine levels and flavors and mods and ... there is so much to take in at once. It cn be intimidating and it's a thousand times easier to go to the store and just pick up a pack of Marlboros/Camels/etc...\n\nI suggest that you do not *try* to quit right away. Just give the ecig a try when you want a cigarette. Each time you reach for your smokes, take a moment and reach for the ecig, give it a few tokes/puffs. \n\nKeep trying to use the ecig more and more rather than just stopping smoking all together. \n\nIt takes a while to break the habit of reaching for a lighter, and it's different. \n\nAlso, when/if you do try vaping, it's a little different than a cigarette when you take that first toke/vape: Buttoned models: Hold the button down and bring the ecig to your mouth, do a long slow inhale. The atomizer needs time to heat up the liquid and vaporize it. \n\nIf you have a no button model: Do a few quick drags off of the ecig, then you can proceed with a long slow inhale. If it cuts off, don't worry. A lot of them have automatic cut off timers. Just wait a few seconds and do another long slow inhale :)\n\n/r/electronic_cigarette has helped many.

And the ability to step down your nicotine is a great option to ending your desire to vape if you like.", "This thread is making me mad that USPS doesn't deliver on New Years. ", 'No local vape shop? Try Wal-Mart!', 'So, I\'m the guy that wrote the other thread (I really hope there isn\'t a user named reverendsaintj with a full inbox right now), and this is why I wrote that post up.\n\nI started smoking at the age of 14.  I lived in a house with smokers, my whole family smoked, and when I got to high-school everyone I was friends with smoked.  The first cigarette I smoked was filched out of my mom\'s pack of Virginia Slims, and it was like coming home.  This was everything that was missing from my life when I wasn\'t sitting in a room full of other smokers.  That was 1989, and I shot up to a pack a day faster than I should have.\n\nFast forward to 2009, I\'m a grown-up now and my wife is pregnant with our first child.  I have at this point tried just about everything to quit, and one of the guys I work with is getting in to this new "vaping" thing.  On his recommendation I went out and picked up what was literally the only affordable hardware at the time, a cigalike kit.  It worked for a little while, but it wasn\'t enough.  It was a pain in the ass to keep going (the battery life was crap, the cartomizers were crap  (they were hard to fill, hard to keep from leaking, hard to keep from scorching) and the overall experience was terrible.  I used them long enough to offset the cost of the kit in cigarettes saved, and then put them on the shelf.\n\nAnother skip-ahead to 2011, the wife and I are expecting kid #2, and our oldest is aware enough to know what daddy does when he goes outside and comes back stinky.  I found ECF, the electronic cigarette forum, and tell them my story.  They make recommendations based on the current hardware available, and I go out and buy more hardware.  A set of eGo batteries and CE4 clearomizers.  This changed the vape from not enough to too much, and I didn\'t even think to try different toppers, different juice, different anything.  The hardware experience was drastically improved, but my experience as a vaper was still not enough to break me away from cigarettes.  I had failed, again.\n\nEarlier this year my job relocated out of state, and if I wanted to stay employed, I was going to have to start commuting.  I got into a carpool with the only remaining smokers in my office.  The three of us (we\'re a dying breed, pun intended) meet up every morning at 5:30 to make the trek down to Northern Virginia, and that early in the day there\'s only one thing to do...  Smoke.  My consumption went from 15-20 cigarettes a day to 35-40 in the space of a few weeks.  I was crushing my lungs, my wallet, and my overall health.  I had done all of my research several times over, I knew what *didn\'t* work for me in terms of vaping, so I ordered some hardware with the intent that I\'d use it in the car to reduce the number of cigs I was smoking each day.  I picked up one variable voltage eGo and a protank (I wanted cinnamon juice, which does not-nice things to acrylic tanks).  It showed up on a Friday afternoon and I started using it that night.  I was blown away at how the current level of equipment performed based on my previous trials, and was extremely happy with my purchase, this was going to work extremely well to cut things back.  Then I woke up the next morning and had my first cig of the day.  \n\nIt. Was. Terrible.\n\nThe taste, the heat, the horrible things it was doing in my chest.  All I wanted to do was to finish the one I had lit as quickly as possible so that I could go find my e-cig and start vaping again.  I made it to lunch before the idea that I should smoke another cigarette hit, and the experience was very similar to what happened that previous morning.  Hotbox the shit out of a cig, enjoy the head rush for a second, go back to vaping.  \n\nI smoked three cigarettes that Saturday, two on Sunday, and had a symbolic "farewell" cig on Monday.  That was November 11th of this year.  After failing on the patch, failing on the lozenges, failing on the gum, the wellbutrin, the Chantix...  After 24 years of doing my damndest to kill myself every day, I was finally a non-smoker.\n\nIf you are thinking about quitting this year, do it.  If you are thinking about using vaping to quit smoking, do it.  You might stumble at first, lord knows I did.  You might buy the wrong thing first, hell, I did that twice.  You might need to come to /r/ECR for help and support, I have been doing that every day for almost two months now.

Maybe not right away, if you can find a brand that doesn't taste like crap when it's re-lit, but you've already bought the damned things - might as well get your money's worth, right?\n\nE-cigs are absolutely different.  I could chain-vape if I wanted to, but what's the point if I've already got all the nicotine I want?

Well we gotta have more guns, always - never fewer, only more...and e-cig?

And when I went to High School, it was ‘cool’ to smoke. I ended up being a pack-a-day smoker.\n\nAfter 44 years (and after trying numerous times to quit smoking; cold turkey, Patches, & Gum) I found E-Cigarettes! After using an E-Cig or PV (Personal Vaporizer) for 1 month, I quit burning tobacco in all forms (Cigarettes, Cigars, & Pipes) on 8/8/2009. I’ve been tobacco free for over 5 years. Personally, I have much better health and greatly improved sense of smell and taste. I have also transitioned from using 32 mg. of nicotine to 2 mg. of nicotine over these 5 years.\n\nI can attest that no one would voluntarily transition from vaping to using a real cigarette as they taste and smell horribly bad!\n\nAs to the science surrounding the benefits of using an e-cig and the lack of second-hand effects to others, there are currently over 50 scientific studies conducted in the last few years showing the benefits of e-cigs & lack of harmful bi-products.', 'Congrats, I have been vaping since 2008 and I never get tired of hearing success stories. I totally agree with Jimbo52. I have only met a few vapers--in 6 years--who still like the taste of burning tobacco. ', "Wow, this is almost my exact story also, just not quite as long.  Pack a day smoker for 25 years, have been completely smoke free for 15 months now. \n\nCongrats on five years dude!\n\nOne thing I would like to add, and it's the reason I intend to keep vaping, is relapsing after quits.  \n\nI'm not sure if you went though this, but during my 25 years of smoking, I successfully quit 3 times (and failed countless times).  Once for 4 months, once for 6 months, and the longest was for 18 months.\n\nEven when I was long over the nicotine addiction, if I would walk past a smoker outside a bar, or just on the street, I would take a deep inhale (passively).  Something in my brain would always long for the sensation of smoking, or maybe just deep down, I just enjoy the sensation. \n\nSo all it would take would be a few to many drinks, a bit of stress, or some other loss of willpower, and I would be back to smoking death sticks. \n\nSo when I discovered vaping, I saw something that wouldn't just get me tobacco free, but keep me free, and give me the pleasurable sensation that I enjoy. \n\nOh, and if I walk past a smoker now, I think it smells like shit. \n\nOne thing I like to tell people, smoking was a habit, vaping is a hobby :)", 'Sounds about right.\n\nI smoked a pack a day and then quit for a few years, but during the time I had "quit", I loved the smell and taste of cigarettes, and I still bummed one here and there.\n\nI was about to break down and buy a pack, but I got an vaporizer instead.... For a while, I still liked the smell and taste of cigarettes and wanted one when friends smoked, but then something happened. I just started hating the smell and taste of cigarettes. Now, I don\'t even have to try to not want one.', 'I always assumed my dad would smoke until it killed him. Started in his teens. By twenty was smoking a pack+ a day.  When I was growing up he tried fucking everything.  Medicine that made his hands swell from allergic reaction, every gum or patch marketed, and even acupuncture.  \n\nTwo years ago after at least 20 attempts to quit he and his wife tried E-cigs. They were smoke free within 2 months. He now uses pretty much nicotine free stuff. E-cigs bought him hopefully a few extra years of life.

Now with 2 young boys I have been trying to quit for a while and have always made it a point not to smoke in front of them.\n\n2 months down and I have on 1 occasion tried an analogue and can say I hated the smell. On another occasion I really wanted to try again what it was like to go analogue but found it much easier to just turn away. I\'m now happy to be able to get my fix while sitting at my desk working and in the house while watching TV.\n\nIt\'s sad to see governments playing the "We don\'t know how dangerous it is" game, when it\'s absolutely clear that vaping is "the best" smoking cessation that real ex-smokers have come across.

I bought my first Spinner and some juice almost 8 months ago and haven't looked back since.  I quit smoking the cigarettes overnight.  Three packs a day to zero with not so much as a wimper.  I've dropped the nic level in my juice, now, to 3 mcg and sometimes 0.  I feel so much better that it can't be put into words.  Vaping saved my life!\n\nMy concern is, tobacco taxes have always been about the revenue.  The gov't doesn't give a rats ass about public health - they want the money.  As more people quit and tax revenue drops, what are we going to be facing?  They will drum up something to attempt to justify taxing juice - all in the name of public health (wink, wink) and a lot of sheep will willingly go along.

Oh that right. It was juul. Also altria is only a major stake holder. They don\'t own the company but they have a huge vote in what happens with it. Also the CEO of the company is an exec from Marlboro. I hate when people say that big tobacco has no interest in killing vaping because " TheY OwN JuuL!! " Juul is an extremely small part of the industry that has continuously fucked over the rest of the industry by marketing to children and not giving a fuck what happens with their devices. They also charge out the ass for juice that\'s worth about 0000.2¢. Juul is for people who don\'t know anything about vaping or just want to jump on a bandwagon to look cool in front of their friends. And that\'s perfectly fine  it\'s great to have an easy usable option for smokers who just want to try a vape without getting into it in the deep end. But regardless Juul has sabotaged the industry on multiple occasions on purpose and doesn\'t give a fuck. They make an exponential amount more off of tobacco than they do selling devices and juices. The profit margins on tobacco are higher and there no real choice. You find the brand/pack you like and you\'ll continue to buy them until you die. Vaping is an ever-changing industry and it\'s really unlikely that people would vape juuls for 20 years or longer. They find a new device that they want to try or a flavor they want and they move on to something better. And Blu is in the exact same boat. Not to mention Blu basically only serves to keep people away from vaping because their products suck major ass and are unappealing once you try them.  you will think vaping isn\'t as good as cancer sticks are and that vaping is all the same. Most older/uninformed people wont actually go into a vape shop. They stop at 7/11 and see a Blu and are like " fuck it I\'ll try one of those " and then they don\'t like it and assume those are all that vaping is. Have you ever seen a Blu device in an actual vape shop ? I haven\'t. Not to mention they still make vastly more off of tobacco products. If the tobacco industry really wanted to get into vaping they could pretty much buy every company they want to outright. The amount of money tobacco companies have are absolutely rediculous. None of this is based on real evidence and recent studies have shown that the actual amount of children who vape on a consistent basis is much lower than they like to say and were already smoking before. A majority of teenage vapers dont even use juices with nicotine. The tobacco industry is rooted so deep in the states pockets that they will do anything to keep the money flowing and stay in the good graces of that hand that feeds them. We\'ve already seen multiple gov. who\'s legislation is directly tied to  tobacco influence/money. And no one will do anything about it because it\'s the norm. Prohibition does absolutely nothing. The black market will spread like a plague and thousands more will die a preventable death which they will use to further push the agenda. This has nothing to do with public health/safety.

They can easily misdirect otherwise righteous anger through their lemmings.', "The attacks on the vaping industry, similar to the prohibition of cannabis (particularly hemp), are the result of several huge industries feeling threatened by a very disruptive product. I see these two as being two very similar sets of circumstances. \n\nThe justification for banning cannabis in full was laid at the feet of marijuana specifically and yet hemp got dragged along for reasons AND more importantly hemp (despite being arguably more beneficial in every way than marijuana) became the back burner issue. People in general have clamored for legalized marijuana at far higher rates than hemp historically. The focus has been imo deliberately funneled onto legalizing marijuana (the less disruptive counterpart to hemp) rather than hemp or cannabis in full. \n\nSimilar to the previous example nicotine vaping is being dragged along with it's less disruptive counterpart THC vaping. The justification for going after nicotine vaping stems from THC vaping. In the former example we have the benefit of hindsight and can examine the full process from start to finish. As for vaping we're currently in the middle of it but I would not be surprised if this all plays out in a very similar way. I also wouldn't be surprised if the attention rightfully turns to THC cartiridges soon leading to a new crackdown on THC products in which nicotine vaping will be dragged along with due to the current conflation being established between the two. \n\nThe biggest difference as I see it between the vape ban and cannabis ban is that one of the largest industries in our country (tobacco) has large investments in this current disruptive product, vaping. That will be the thing that keeps it alive whereas hemp flatlined. However, established tobacco companies will end up with the keys to the kingdom and will then help Gov't establish guidelines for the industry that create a barrier to entry far too high for new competitors to enter the market. When's the last time a new cigarette company entered the game that wasn't a subsidiary of the big 2 or 3? \n\nAlso I should note that thankfully the current administration has made growing hemp in the US legal at the federal level but most states still outlaw it.\n\nEdits: spelling, phrasing, formatting.", 'Since it is well documented that cigarettes and cigars are " hazardous to your health ", then why aren\'t they banned? Young people still smoke cigarettes despite the regulation and monitoring of stores which sell tobacco products. Tobacco use and the vaping of harmful THC are just symptoms of a greater problem. In order for children, teens, and even older adults to make healthier choices, wouldn\'t it make more sense to teach healthy self- care practices and provide therapies which focus on the management of extreme emotions, stress, and aberrant behaviors, i.e. Dialectical Behavioral Therapy  (DBT), instead of spending all this time, effort, and money on banning flavored ejuice. Another important area that needs attention which can encourage healthy choices is the provision of supportive home environments and greater opportunities for family therapy. If a person, child or otherwise, is emotionally and physically healthy there\'s a greater possibility that the practices of smoking tobacco and/or adulterated THC vaping will decrease. From my personal experience, I\'ve stopped smoking cigarettes after 44 yrs. By changing to vaping I\'ve been able to decrease my nicotine level from 24mg to 3mg. Flavored ejuice is probably the most important aspect of vaping that keeps me from returning to cigarettes. I also am a DBT graduate and participate group therapy.

Hopefully it simplifies some of the confusion for those wanting to quit and better their life. +1 for leaving out cigalikes and other junk.", 'Wow, thank you for the kind words man. ', 'I feel like NO ONE ever mentions to beginners how different levels of nicotine vape, and it also differs hugely to each device. When vaping on a large RBA or RDA 18ml would wreck my throat, I vape at 3-6mg. But when using a smaller pen style device 13-18mg is fine. Also when I started vaping I kept messing around thinking my vape was too hot when I was really just too high of a nicotine content.  \n\nEdit: Because it looks like I made the top post, I would like to take the chance to at least explain to any noobies a little more in depth what I wish someone told me! When I first started vaping, I wanted something that made big clouds, had a cool(not too hot) vape, and enough nicotine to keep me from craving. I knew this was possible, I had used an old co-workers mechmod once before and really enjoyed it. I got 26650 Mod and a big TOBH Atty, plus an ohmeter+kanthal and started learning and building away. It seemed to me like no matter what I did the vape was too hot or too harsh, but if I went too high in resistance(ohms) the vape just sucked. I couldn\'t figure out what I was doing wrong and any time I went to a B&M I would say it was too hot or harsh and I wanted it cooler, they\'d just say to "try a higher gauge wire, add more wraps, try new juices" Yada yada yada. It took me a good 2-3 weeks to figure out TWO very important things for myself that made me enjoy vaping oh so much more. AIRFLOW, the drip tip I had, and the drip tips I see around at most B&M\'s were way to small. They all may fit a 510 connection but many of them have tiny little funnels for the air to travel through causing it to restrict a lot of air. Second was nicotine level. I kept thinking my vape was too hot when really it was too harsh. There is a difference. To any newbies out there, if it seems too hot/harsh to you, especially on the exhale, the likely reason is that your vaping too high of a Nic level for your setup. I found out that with my Tobh(I\'ve tried many more RBA\'s and RDA\'s at this point and daily a Doge now) I could take HUGE mouth to lung hits, have cool vapor, no harshness, and really enjoy my vape. I had used Crappy eGo kits etc before and vaped them with 24mg+ nic content and it seemed like no big deal, but learning how to BALANCE airflow, coil resistance, and Nicotine levels are the most important things that lead to me enjoying vaping and being able to drop the cigarettes for good. This knowledge is just a base point, but for me is what made it worth it. You can get involved in all the different flavors, mods and atomizers out there but if you don\'t really learn the craft and what YOU enjoy an what works for you then you will just keep chasing something that isn\'t there.  \nBest of luck to all of you, Merry Christmas and happy holidays! ', "That's exactly my biggest confusion as a newbie.  I bought a starter pack to test it out two weeks ago and I definitely won't go back to cigarettes.  Well,  a friend handed me the juice I use since then and it's a 18mg mix.  I guess I vape about 1,2-1.6ml at a normal day and up to 4 at a party.  \n\nI wonder if that means that I have my nicotine  input raised up,  when I was smoking 16 cigarettes with 0.9mg each before,  and not more than 30 at a night out?  \n\n\n", "Nicotine is a weird thing to teach about unless the user can try the different levels. Harshness, throat hit, and satisfaction are so subjective that it's difficult to recommend what level to start on, especially considering the varying performance of hardware. I generally tell most smokers to try 12mg (in a mouth-to-lung hit tank) and go up or down from there. ", "Yep, when I started with my kayfun I was pushing 40-50W. The store clerk said for a kayfun I'd need 12-18mg.

That 24mg made me sick as hell. ', "I think that the primary reason is that someone new isn't going to be using an RBA right off the bat. Vivis or Protanks are more likely. \n\nNow later on they will likely learn the hard way... ", "I've been using an evod device for about six months, and had no idea that this was the case. Would I be better switching to a mod sorta thingy and using a lower-nicotine juice?

I just got started with a provari mini with an aspire nautilus tank, now vaping mister-e's jade ice with 12mg nicotine... it tastes great but can cause that annoying itchyness in the throat during exhalation. \n\nI've read that VG based liquids are much better and irritate the throat less... so should I try a lower nicotine level or switch to VG?", "There is a lot that I feel I don't understand. Been using an eGo for a year now and I want to upgrade. One thing that I just don't get is the difference with the atties. My eGo has adjustable voltage and I've used different atties (1.8 ohms - 2.1) I have no idea what the difference is or what changing the volts does. Looking at an iStick at the moment,  and that's got VV and VW, so now im super confused.

I started at that level with the Nauty and I was constantly buzzed throughout the day. I dropped to 12mg next day and 1 week later to 9mg.

It's *going* to be, but it isn't yet.\n\nIt is, however, a legal substance in all 50 states, where THC isn't.  And as such, there is legal recourse against the manufacturer and/or the shop that sold you the juice, so it is in the manufacturer's best interest to make things right, vs. cutting like the black market THC stuff.  That's the whole underlying cause, after all. Illegal THC is expensive so dealers will cut it if they can.  Prior to vitamin E acetate, cut THC was clearly obvious as it was thinner, but vitamin E acetate is a thick liquid with a golden color just like THC, making it the perfect agent to mix in with cut THC to thicken it back up and look like you're getting the full product you thought you were paying for.  Instead, you got death.\n\nThat, and even shoddy nicotine juice makers (in-house makers who just slop stuff around in a back office, juice that's clearly been contaminated with insects, etc) aren't putting in stuff that can kill you (well, usually -- I'm looking at you, Cuttwood and your attempts to sell juice with titanium dioxide).  And when bad things happen, the community and the market doesn't hesitate in calling out the bad actors.

After having the concentrate, I would drip some directly onto my coil and vape. Delicious! It worked, but it was quick to burn up and gunk my coils. I could add it to the juice, but it seemed the PG was not a good vehicle for the THC like it is for nicotine. Also, if it sat for more than a day or two it would fall out of suspension, and just hang out in the bottom of the bottle.\n\nTHC binds to fats. It\'s why butters and oils are commonly used to make edibles. How many THC-filled watermelons do you see on the shelves? So my thought was to use an oil, which I had coconut oil available, suspend the THC and combine that with some flavor, and some VG. It worked, but tasted like shit. It lasted about a week.\n\nFrom there I gave up and just went to making tinctures, little known to me I was saving my pulmonary functions.\n\nThe point is, from my experience, you can\'t have THC in suspension without oil. The oil, when vaped, condenses in your lungs. The vapor comes out, oil doesn\'t. You absorb the THC, so you\'re still getting high, just not releasing the oils. So you do more carts, keep getting high, and continue filling your bronchial track with oil.\n\nNicotine doesn\'t require the use of lipids to act as a vehicle, so it isn\'t used. To be honest, I\'m unsure if nicotine CAN be delivered via oils; I\'m not a chemist. But for people to be using ecigs exclusively for over a decade and not hearing about this uptick in pulmonary disease, there had to be a change in the market. It would seem it would have been either the nic salts which have seen a rise in popularity or THC carts.\n\nI guess only time will really tell. If the bans occur in the US as it seems on track to happen, we\'ll be finding out in a few years if it is related to current ecig composition or something else. I have a feeling the PG/VG/Nicotine will be harder to obtain, so people will get creative in finding methods to circumvent the systems. Similar to me in the beginning of this post, experimenting with different formulas to find the best possible and passable method. This is where we will see an uptick of non-THC cart related pulmonary disease and the public shift will be pointed back to ecigs and be demonized even more.\n\nIf anyone has their doubts, I implore them to look at the current restrictions on cannabis and the amount of people who turned to spice, or the restrictions on LSD and the amount of people who turned to 25C-NBOMe, or the restrictions on cocaine and the amount of people who turned to bath salts. Each of these illegal drugs can be safely used and enjoyed, but their "legal" (or more readily available) counterparts are more toxic and often more legal.

Essentially, pneumonia.\n\nI was talking to a pulmonologist recently who mentioned that about 50 years ago there was a rise in this same type of oil-based pneumonia. People would drink a spoon full of mineral oils to act as a laxative, typically before bed. When they would lie down, the oil that coated the mouth and throat would trickle down into the lungs. When people stopped with the nightly oils, the pneumonia cases decreased.\n\nThe THC carts use Vitamin E to deliver the THC as PG/VG does not make successful, long term solution. With the rise of cannabis and the consumer wanting affordable and discreet products, the market quickly adapted to the first viable product. Now that we know the oils are the problem, it will be back to the drawing board to figure in what can be done to have the product not kill people.

If the point is to show that I, Tony, (not ZampleBox, but myself as an individual) have ownership in multiple companies… then, yes you are 100% correct. How is that a bad thing? And how is it possibly a bad thing that I have ownership in a domain called Vape Amazing? I'm sure lots of members on ECR own a lot of domain names. I just don't follow the point of this or why is in any way bad.\n\nI feel that *my personal* actions and interests are being **completely** mistaken for *ZampleBox’s* actions and interests. \n\nI, Tony (not ZampleBox), am involved in **many** businesses other than ZampleBox (as is the case with most entrepreneurs). That includes vaping related companies and also non-vaping related companies just as **many** of my peers in the industry are (the list of my peers with multiple vaping companies is longer than the list of those with one). \n\nI, Tony,  (**not** ZampleBox) had an ownership interest in Clear Creek before it was shut down. This was in exchange for the capital I put up to fund the vision for the company. I also have ownership in Vape Amazing, ZampleTrader (coming soon), PeerVape (coming soon), a balsamic company, an app development company and several other startup ventures. That does **not** mean ZampleBox has an ownership in those entities, that means that I, Tony, do and there is nothing wrong with working hard and having multiple companies. \n\nClear Creek is no longer in operation and all of the remarks I’ve said have been factual and honest. If you read the AMA, you’ll see that. **There is no partnership between Clear Creek and ZampleBox at this time nor will there be in the future because CC is no longer in operation**. I also have stated several times in the AMA that ZB *was* partnered with Clear Creek and ZB provided the creative and marketing services while CC provided liquid production. This is 100% factual. \n\n\n\nThe relationship between ZB and CC is clearly stated in the AMA by the ZB team: http://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/2zqxhi/ama_zamplebox_team_here_to_answer_all_of_your/ . It is 100% factual. \n\nI still don’t know why we are even talking about CC or how it is relevant. Their products aren’t in ZB and they aren’t affiliated with ZB as they aren’t even a company anymore. \n\nIn any case, I have been asked a lot of questions in the last 24 hours and have answered them truthfully, so I think it’s only fair if I get to ask a question: \n\n**Yes, I, Tony, (not ZampleBox) have ownership in several companies which include CC (before it closed) and Vape Amazing, why is this a bad thing and how is it at all relevant to ZampleBox especially when CC isn’t even affiliated with ZampleBox anymore?**\n\nBest,\n\nTony \n\nFounder @ ZB\n", 'You pumping out your own "personal" company\'s ejuice into zample box is a problem.

I\'ve given you MULTIPLE chances to admit to your involvement in Clear Creek and each time you have given me not the full story not half of it by a small portion, at first it was just buying ejuice, then it was doing web development and product logo design, now you\'ve admitted to ownership in the company.

It was always a shell company to give you plausible deniability to not making your own ejuice.

And there would have been lots of reason to publicly pimp the company to receive more support.

d1wo68|*|My perspective on the THC Vape health issues (cannabis lab director)|*|["The nicotine vaping community is having to learn a lot about the THC vaping industry quickly due to this issue.  \n\nWe've shunned the topic before because it is a separate product with its own forums. Now we have to know for safety concerns, but also just to answer knowledgeably when the topic inevitably comes up. Even with coworkers and family.  \n\nThanks for the quick lesson. Information is needed.", "> Information is needed.\n\nAbsolutely. There is a terrifying lack of literacy in the cannabis community with regard to vapor products and safety. It's the weirdest mixture of 'cutting edge' and 2010 tek... We still don't have temp control devices for christsake...\n\nedit: to all the people pointing out that temp control devices like the Pax Era exist (also the dosist). You are correct, and I'm going to be straight with you I just kind of forgot it existed. That said, let me clarify by saying the VAST MAJORITY of thc vape products sold are not temp control. There are plenty of batteries that have basic power control, low/med/high settings, maybe even preheat functions. But those are not true temp control. I'm talking about nichrome or SS wire carts that allow a real temp control to take place being wide spread, and that would be fantastic for allowing patients/users to have fine tuned control of their devices and it's effects.", "I live out in Hawaii. After my parents heard about these cases on our local news stations, they sent me a text saying I should stop my bad habit soon. I did a quick research on the article and a few others and noticed they all had one thing in common...THC products...I told them that I don't vape that kind of juice and they shouldn't have to worry. But it does give regular nicotine vaping a bad name.", 'I\'ve been lucky enough to work in a pot shop through this whole thing, so I\'ve been getting updates and new information from the owners/customers.

And you're absolutely right. I had to do a lot of my own legwork trying to find the commonality. Once I did, I started educating them. And once I told them it was not only cartridges, but black market *THC* cartridges, they understood immediately that I was in no danger. I'm all for legalizing marijuana. I personally don't like it, but I'll never stand in the way of progress, especially since it's a great alternative to opioids in many cases. Not to mention how it helps with forms of cancer.", 'This last week alone I had to explain to 50 people the deaths are from THC NOT NICOTINE VAPING.

It feels like being stabbed in the back by something i was heavily involved in getting legalized.', '> We\'ve shunned the topic before because it is a separate product with its own forums\n\nIMHO we correctly shunned it, but we didn\'t do enough.  We needed to differentiate terminology (and since you can\'t make other people stop using words, you can only choose your own, we should\'ve moved away from "vaping" on to something like "electronic nicotine delivery"/ENDS).  But we didn\'t, and now "vaping" is killing people, and it doesn\'t matter that it\'s THC vape because the cloud blowing, Subaru driving, "Do you even vape?" bro is such a meme of course that\'s what people think of when they hear "A kid died from vaping."

It\'s harm reduction practices, which should have always been the goal with drugs.

States without regulated marijuana are creating the black market demand for these products, as the OP stated, tested cartridges can\'t get away with the addition of any cut nor should they.

I know that this is not necessarily everyone's experience but its the only time i've felt unsafe smoking anything.\n\nOn another note, i'm surprised how little crossover there is between both communities.

When the first stories started popping up, I said, "Well, that sounds a hell of a lot like lipid pneumonia."  The doctors are still hedging a bit, but most are saying it\'s "almost certainly" lipid pneumonia.  Which means it is.\n\nAnd I\'ve been saying that the vaping community has known about lipid pneumonia for a very long time, as it was one of the boogeymen that was used to scare people away from vaping back in the earlier days (I dipped my toe into the scene in 2009 and started vaping fulltime in 2011, and lipid pneumonia was something we all knew not to fuck around with back then).  But people tell me, "I\'ve never heard of that."  It seems as our nicotine vaping community and market matured, we forgot our history.  Like, we still call mods "mods", but do people remember why they\'re called that? (because in the early days, if you wanted something better than a cigalike, you had to make your own hardware, usually by modifying flashlight tubes, thus "mod")  And somewhere along the lines we lost our healthy fear of lipid pneumonia.  I\'m sure liquid makers never lost it (if they ever had it, anyway; I\'m not sure many of the newer manufacturers ever even thought about it, and certainly very few in-house B&M juice makers would have worried about it because their source material made it irrelevant) and were diligent about keeping oil out of our juice, but the rank and file forgot to be scared.\n\nIf the nicotine vaping community a decade ago was the wild west, the weed vaping community is far worse.  And that\'s because it\'s still illegal more places than it\'s not, as you say.  But even legal shops are playing fast and loose, in comparison to nicotine juice makers.\n\n> the average cannabis consumer, cart user, or dispensary owner will not even TOUCH Propylene Glycol.

With metals and what not ?", "Answered another guy who asked something very similar: \n\n>How do you know your vape carts don't have any heavy metals in them? If it comes from China isn't it all contaminated?\n\nWell, that's a complicated question. Short answer is we test them! Long answer is we test all of our incoming raw ingredients, including non cannabis ingredients (NCI's) for a full Cat 3 Panel. That includes Heavy metals, pesticides, foreign material, microbial and fungal, And comply fully with state guidelines. We of course are legally required to test again after manufacturing, same full panel in whats called a COA (certificate of analysis) and if we don't pass (and can't fix it, you usually can't) you have to destroy the batch. It's kind of a big deal, the CDPH and or BCC gets involved. We try and head that off with R&D testing to know if something is going to fail ahead of time and avoid it.\n\nAs for the carts, well we recommend clients source quality authentic components. I've yet to see one of the authentic CCells we recommend fail a heavy metal test. I've tested ones we've left sitting around for over 6mo and had them pass (though not at a non-detect). Most batches we see are a non detect or LOQ. Sometimes we get a small spike. I won't put anything out over 50% of action limit for liability reasons, way too easy for a retest to show higher and then we have the fun of a recall. NOT FUN. That said, I have seen rando carts and devices fail. We're a contract manufacturer. We work with the device the client provides more often then not. We can steer them in the right direction, but if they are hellbent on saving a buck, then on their head be it. We usually catch it in R&D testing, they eat the loss and learn their lesson. I'm very confident everything leaving our facility is safe.\n\nTruth of the matter is that poison is in the dose. The state of CA has determined that cannabis can have up to .5 ug/g (parts per billion).

From what I gathered, it was quite common.\n\nWell, honeycut was by no means the only or even the most popular cut. They were just the "noisiest" on IG. Floraplex and TrueTerpenes were absolutely moving shit-tons of the stuff. \nAs far as prevelence in the industry, it\'s hard to say. On the licensed end of things, I don\'t think it\'s super common and we can see that because almost everyone that has gotten sick has gotten their cart black market. The cuts don\'t work when you have to get it tested. Even though a thickener lets me make a cart that LOOKS like it is 80-85% potency, it doesn\'t matter because the vendor won\'t touch it if it tests under 80% (it just won\'t sell). As far as getting doctored results, I don\'t know. I know we only work with top-tier labs. We actually have a rigorous qualification procedure we make labs go through before we\'ll shunt \'em any of out testing business, including hitting w/n a certain margin of error with a known potency reference samples diluted down to various levels, correctly identifying selected terpene blends, etc... The lab we work with (and I\'ll give \'em a shout out, they\'re awesome, <3 earthlabs) does NOT fuck around. They show up and select random samples out of the batch, with a gopro recording them (in addition to our HD cameras so there is redundant records of compliance). We can\'t touch anything during this process, even if it\'s not meant to be interferring. We had one pickup when the lab guy was picking up product for testing and dropped a box on the ground. One of our distro employees who was doing inventory nearby just bent over to pick it up, just being helpful, but they had to scrap the pickup, put everything back and come back the next day and re-do everything just to avoid any appearance of impropriety! \n\nFor the blackmarket guys, who knows... I think we can see it was fairly common, and the people showing up as sick are the ones that were using a lot. even if you had a badly cut cart I doubt a couple of hits would affect the average healthy adult. It wouldn\'t be good for you, but it\'s not like "puff puff dead" \n\n>Also, why do you think Marijuana has such an aversion to VG/PG? Researching the topic awhile back, it seemed that MCT oil was the common carrier of choice, though I could find no actual science stating it quickly metabolizes in the lung, due to its shorter chain chemistry. I was shocked when I found out much of the cannabis industry was pushing oil based solutions.\n\nDude, that is the million dollar question. I think it\'s a lot of factors, and I could go on about this for a lot longer than I think most of y\'all want to read. But it boils down to a lack of scientific literacy and rumors and misinformation. \nRemember that shitty formaldyhyde study/hitjob that rocked the vape world a few years back? Yeah, the cannabis side of things never got over that or even fully understood it. Also, the PG cut carts got a reputation for being generally shitty. Back in the day any jackass that wanted a blackmarket brand would dilute whatever shit oil he had w/ 1:1 or 2:1 or 3:1 pg to oil and sell \'em to dispos. High PG content is harsh and not super fun to vape, especially on shitty clearomizers. Then "the Clear" came out, the first guys selling distillate and this uncut high potency oil came to be associated with potency and purity. \n\nIts a weird industry man. People switched to MCT because \'hurr durr it\'s coconuts, they\'re natural! better than that antifreeze pg\' and you can try to argue and try to educate but your average purchasing manager at a dispensary is stoned off their ass and doesn\'t give a shit. \n\nI\'ve seen the same thing for years on the extraction side of things. The number of people that claim to love on Co2 extraction because it\'s "solvent free" blows my mind. CO2 IS THE SOLVENT (not to mention that it has to be post processed by dissolving it in ethanol, another solvent, and filtered)  Solvent by itself doesn\'t mean bad or good, just a substance that dissolves a solute, to form a solution. Butane extraction is great, cost effective, and makes a killer product. We just make extra sure we get it all back out, lab test down to the parts per billion, and it makes a better product twice as fast for half the money. But oh god no it\'s made with a solvent!

Or that at least certain isomers are beneficial. https://www.atsjournals.org/doi/full/10.1164/rccm.201303-0503ED\nOf course, what is actually being used on the market, and what is being used in a peer reviewed research study are different matters entirely. \nAlso, a certain % of the population seems to have some sort of allergic reaction to the vit e acetate, in the form of contact dermatitis. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20487657\nIt\'s possible that we\'re seeing cases in persons allergic to the substance, if indeed that is what this is, though the apparent lipidosis of presenting patients suggests it\'s more in the way of a lipid contamination of the product being used. \n\n3. Seeing some cool stuff come out on this front. I posted a reply to someone else mentioning that we\'re still in the stone age on the THC side, and that we don\'t even have temp control. I was (rightfully) called out on that was as there ARE temp control devices such as the pax era. I clarified by saying the vast majority of products being sold are not temp control nor do they have that capability. Most of whats on the market is standard 510 carts and disposables, and maybe devices have a preheat or power settings, but most are on/off button batteries. \n\nWe\'re in talks with a company bringing some pretty cool temp and wattage control devices out, I can\'t say specifics due to an NDA but there are cool things coming to the industry that are seeking to change the lack of control in hardware. \n\nI will say that I would like to the same temp control compatible coils brought to widespread use in the cannabis side. there\'s no reason to have devices get as hot as they do. Particularly with terpenes the amount of flavor preservation you get with low temperature hits is significant. Being able to precisely control the temperature of your coil would go a long way to preserving the integrity of the oil in your cartridge throughout it\'s life, as well as making sure that the flavor you\'re getting is what it\'s supposed to be. I think it would also reduce returns for "burnt" Cartridges. Something I\'ve noticed is that cannabis cartridged users tend to not understand wicking, or the need to give the thick viscous oil time to re-wick between rips.', 'Thanks for the read.

That and I also go to a dispensary here in Vancouver that prides themselves on making the purest honey oils possible with absolute minimal additives. They test every batch for a ton of different contaminants. I've been using these honey oil carts for I would say 6 months now and haven't had any issues. My questions are, do you think I'm okay to keep using them? Also, who would you say is to blame for this whole ordeal? Manufacturers? The government? Sellers? A combination of all 3?", "It sounds like you have a solid dispensary, though lab testing for contaminants wouldn't show anything they're not looking for. ie if they're using a thickener they know it's there so they're not testing for it, if that makes sense.

I used to smoke before that, but never hard-core (pack a week or so, and mainly just when stressed).  Vaping allowed me to have that nicotine relaxation and not smell like someone dumped an ash tray over my head.\n\nI like your theory on the pneumonia.  It goes hand-in-hand with my experiences with vaping with the larger tanks and sub-ohm coils with WAY better clouds than we got years ago.  The flavors are also MUCH better and more diverse than we had when I first started.  The thing I started seeing in myself was that my asthma was MUCH worse during allergy season.  I had minor asthma when I was a kid ( I played soccer for over 11yrs playing midfield and goalie), but it was never very bad.  After getting caught up in the "BIG Cloud Craze" a few years ago, I have noticed that I can\'t handle the PG.  Taking a hit off of a 80/20 (VG/PG) flavor causes me to cough and tightness in my chest for a couple hours.  Nothing a breath-taking cough, but that irritated limp-rag cough that just makes you feel like a wimp.  Moving to 85/15 mix solves the cough issue and I can vape normally again.  I went to a Blue Man concert last year, and literally thought I was going to die right there on the floor.  Fog machines were never really a big issue...but DAYUM...I literally sat on the floor wheezing curled up in a ball wondering if I could get the breath to ask my wife to call 911 to get me out of there in the middle of the show.  Call me stupid, but I coughed and wheezed the rest of the way through that $120 per person show, and almost crawled outside to hack and cough and try to breathe on the monorail.\n\nThat experimentation got me thinking about PG in vapes.  Then "all" of the deaths hitting mainstream and the Blame Game starting up for vapes in general.  If you add the fact that Vaping creates "water" vapor, it stands to reason that "water" will stand in your lungs until dissolved.  That liquid standing in your lungs is typically how pneumonia is identified.  Now that we have the pneumonia link, then you add in the asthma portion of this.  If you are suffering an asthma attack, you will have increased shortness of breath (which is already decreased due to the liquid in your lungs).  Both asthma and pneumonia kill people regularly, but not  a lot of Press on it anymore because it is so common.\n\nNow you add in the barely (if at all in some states) regulated THC/CBD pods that will help you to relax, then you have a true formula to kill people.  Think about it...you are having trouble breathing and your panic sets in...what do you reach for when you are panicking?  Your handy vape with CBD inside to relax, right?

Municipal codes tend to dictate (at least for us) how the facility is built out, which can vary wildly depending on your locale. The CDPH does audits and has a wide amount of discretion on things they can decide to enforce.\n\nFunny enough this was another one of my topics I covered in my presentation. CGMP and FDA regulations. I covered the fact that it\'s a matter of time before they become the rule rather than the exception in the cannabis industry and the smart boys and girls out there would be preparing now rather than scrambling later. We made the investment upfront when we built our facilities and it will be a matter of going through the approval process rather than scrambling to get compliant. Somethings we are required to do by the regulations do mirror CGMP rules however, for example our batch records (both electronic and hardcopy backups) are very elaborate and cover everything you would expect to see in a CGMP facility. In our last audit they selected 4 random products in our distribution warehouse and without my help the auditor had to be able to "walk through" the entire production chain, to trace source materials back throughout the process. Fortunately (for us, not the trees) we go above and beyond what is required documentation-wise (again, prepare now for FDA and CGMP) and it was easy-breezy. \n\n\n>Is this being handled by a state agency in California or is it self-enforced?\n\nState agencies.\n\n>Also, while it\'s quoted that these cases of acute lung disease are from products purchased at unlicensed pop-up shops, you seem to imply that manufacturers (who are "legit" enough to be at an industry presentation) are using these specific isomers too.

3090ya|*|PSA: This is how imminent these regulations are....|*|['I think the general public needs to realize that this battle is not one over safety, or just about big tobacco "swooping in" to the market. Look at it on a larger scale. Like it or not, eliminating the traditional tobacco industry would be damaging to the US economy. (Note: Don\'t consider this comment as being in support of regulation. Read the rest first.)\n\nThere\'s the obvious surface issue of a non locally- and federally-taxed product competing with [one of the top tax earners in the country.](http://dailycaller.com/2011/02/28/what-would-an-america-without-smokers-cost/) We are talking about a product that the government heavily relies on for revenue. Increasing tax levels have not made a significant difference in consumer habit; either. Also a "surface" issue is the consideration that traditional cigarettes are statistically a habitual loop; you will probably be a consumer for the remainder of your life. A product designed to break this cycle isn\'t good news for a government that relies on the stability of the tobacco consumerism as a primary revenue generator. Couple this with the fact that it is significantly easier for a politician to suggest tax increases on taboos, you have a pretty good recipe for revenue generation. \n\n**Dig deeper.** [The health care industry generated $133 billion revenue as a direct result of smoking-related illness between 2009-2012.](http://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics/fact_sheets/economics/econ_facts/) Electronic cigarettes jeopardize that revenue stream. The agriculture and logistics markets would invariably suffer, too.\n\n**At the end of the day, smokers die earlier. This costs less for the government, as well.**\n\n“Smokers actually save the government money, both by dying earlier and thus reduce social security payments, and, to a lesser extent, by dying of relatively cheap ailments like lung cancer, a fairly quick killer, rather than more expensive, lingering ailments.”\n\nWhat is a government to do at this point? They are scrambling to mitigate revenue loss, generated directly by tobacco. The possibilities are to either:\n\n* Tax the vaping industry at the same rate as cigarettes are taxed. The con in their eyes: this still doesn\'t solve the issue of vaping being a smoking cessation product. There is a long history of tobacco taxation that won\'t be fought, and tobacco has a high "consumer retention rate". \n\nSo, the next \'logical\' thing to do would be to:\n\n* Cripple the industry to protect tobacco-generated revenue and prevent any financial hardships that would follow suit.\n\n[The government has relied on tobacco taxation as a staple of its portfolio for more than 100 years] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revenue_Act_of_1862), so it\'s pretty clear to see what\'s going on here in my opinion. Sure, you can try to make the blow easier by hiding behind the veil of health concerns, and perhaps some of the lesser political puppets will take the bait. In the end, though, it seems pretty evident that the situation is about a flawed taxation system. When an innovative product comes along that saves lives and generate tens of thousands of small businesses around the country but threatens pulling the financial rug out from under an already economically-weak government, their solution will be to stomp out the disruptors. \n\nThere will have to be a compromise of some nature, unfortunately. The government has been heavily reliant on taxing a taboo that we are ultimately eliminating. They will either seek to regain lost revenue by taxing the vaping industry, or look to crush the industry as a whole to maintain status quo. \n\nMy two cents.\n\n**EDIT:** A lot of people have been tossing around solutions; here\'s what I think a feasible defense looks like. Considering the vaping industry is largely comprised of "small business", there is no single entity that has the cashflow to facilitate Washington lobbying. I think we can all agree that lobbying, coupled with a strong association and rock-solid scientific studies, is the quickest way to produce tangible results. \n\nThere are the likes of NJOY et al., but their agenda is different than the community agenda. A proposed discussion point is to have a single representative body carry out the hiring and management of top-tier industry lobbyists to give these guys hell for the next couple of years. Lobbying *could* buy time while the industry strengthens, and we should see some larger corporations of sizable valuation rise up and aid in combatting harsh regulation. Secondarily, third party scientific testing will need to be performed on the behalf of the vape community, which is not a cheap endeavor either. Thirdly, campaigns need to be created to combat the smear campaigns and misinformation being run against the industry. This combo seems to be one of the only ways real progress will be made.\n\nThe issue of funding is a big one, of course. [NJOY, for example, spent $340,000 last year in lobbying on the State.] (http://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/clientsum.php?id=F6953%20%20%20%20%20&year=2014) There will undoubtedly be the need for a good cash reserve in order to accomplish anything, and the industry is way too young to have corporate giants that will lead the pillage. I see this happening in a few different ways, ranked in order of efficacy:\n\n* **Community Donations.** If you want to fight, pony up. I\'m sorry to tell you, but an email to your Congressman won\'t be bringing any kind of change. Money fights money.\n\n* **Fundraising Campaigns.** You see these with all major associations; the vaping industry should be no different. A proper campaign will double as a great mass-market awareness tool.\n\n* **B&M and Online Shop-Solicited Donation Requests.** Self explanatory, customer opt-in.\n\n* **A Weekly or Monthly day where a portion of nationwide purchases goes to the campaign.** A sliver of all purchases made on said day will go towards the cause. Consider this, ironically, a tax of sorts. The difference is, it will be a selective participation event and it will be paid for on the shop-end. State bodies use this method in other scenarios very successfully. \n\n**No one else will fight for you; in life, in business, and in vaping.** Everyone has an agenda, and for a fight to be even remotely successful, this needs to be the adopted mentality. Money will continue to be the most effective way to fight money, as it historically has. The question is; how bad does the community want to preserve our industry?\n\nSorry for the hijack, /u/TropicalWalrus.', '[deleted]', "You mention increasing tax levels not having an impact on consumer habits; I looked up the info a month or two ago for my country (Canada) to back up a point I was trying to make, and while the number of people smoking has been reduced by more than half since 1985, the amount of revenue has stayed steady, and in some years even surpassed what they brought in when there were more people smoking. \n\nSell 10 of something for $5, or 5 of something for $10, and you're making $50 either way. I admittedly don't know much about how it all works, but I'd say they're arguably making more money because selling less product would seem to mean less overhead to deal with while still bringing in the same amount at the end of the day. I could be entirely wrong about that, though.\n\nRegardless, everything you say is true.\n\n[Number of Canadian smokers](http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/hc-ps/tobac-tabac/research-recherche/stat/ctums-esutc_2012-eng.php)\n\n[Tax revenue, not including sales tax or goods and services tax](http://www.smoke-free.ca/pdf_1/totaltax.pdf)\n\nUnless I'm interpreting something incorrectly, this pretty much sums up the government's issue with vaping.", 'I hope you don\'t mind that I chime in.\n\nTo be candid in my introduction, I work with the News & Review based out of California, and have been working with /u/StefanDidak from SFATA, CASAA, and other vape-related organizations on some projects that you just listed. [Here\'s my background, and a brief introduction to the background of my company](http://norcal.sfata.org/2015/03/we-need-action/). Our clients include The Salvation Army, Citibank, and numerous health care organizations. You can find our website [here](http://www.nrpubs.com).\n\nLet me reiterate and add to some points that you\'ve made:\n\n> ...campaigns need to be created to combat the smear campaigns and misinformation being run against the industry. This combo seems to be one of the only ways real progress will be made.\n\nYes. If there\'s any proof that we can bring up as of late, we should look to the rising popularity of [notblowingsmoke.org](http://www.notblowingsmoke.org). Stefan has done a fantastic job (and in a very quick time frame) to give the general public the option of what they choose to read. What they choose to believe is a different story. \n\nI want to address efforts spent developing "counter-campaigns". They will only take you so far, especially if your opposition has the funds to flood the market with the information they want to spread. If you keep trying to fix leaks as they pop up rather than take preventative measures to make sure they don\'t occur, you\'re going to end up chasing more problems than you can handle. You also run the risk of drawing more attention to their efforts. \n\n> Community Donations. If you want to fight, pony up. I\'m sorry to tell you, but an email to your Congressman won\'t be bringing any kind of change. Money fights money.\n\nThose efforts still count - but you need to be aware of what your message conveys.\n\nI\'ll highlight this because I feel it\'s important to discuss:\n\n> *Money fights money.*\n\n**This is true, but you need to know how/where your money is spent**. We started working with Citibank on a financial literacy publication for their "Money Matters" program. This regional, ~$20,000 project - a blip on their $65 million dollar marketing budget - ended up being the most effective use of their marketing dollars for this program. They approached us after the first project\'s success, and then we adapted it for 16 regions with over 2 million circulation.\n\n> Fundraising Campaigns. You see these with all major associations; the vaping industry should be no different. A proper campaign will double as a great mass-market awareness tool.\n\nAround 2006-2007, certain government agencies threatened to shut down our Sacramento newspaper for allowing 420 advertisements to run. As a company run by individuals who marched during the civil rights movement, we chose not to back down and stand by our business partners.\n\nOne of my partners has been the marketing representative for most of our 420/Cannabis business partners for the past eight years. Five years ago, she started "Collective Giving" in an effort to get most of her dispensaries to raise funds for the community and raise awareness for good business practices. The results have been phenomenal. Two years ago, Collective Giving gathered nearly 4,000 pounds of canned goods for a local food bank. Their second fundraiser gathered $4,000 in cash donations for a community-based cancer peer navigation program with joint effort from the UC Davis Comprehensive Cancer Center. You can find more information about Collective Giving on their website [here](http://www.collective-giving.com/).\n\nAnyways - good post.

Also research to see if there's any advocacy groups specific to your area.\n\n* If you have the time, consider going to legislative meetings in your local area to oppose anti-vaping bills.\n\n* Urge local vendors or vendors you frequently buy from to take action as well (in whatever means they possibly can).\n\n* Spread the word to anybody that you know to support our cause.", 'Dick Durbin is the guy that put the provision into the Higher Education Act that strips federal funding away from students convicted of drug crimes, including simple possession.

Seems to me that all other types of inhaled, injected, or ingested products are regulated on some level why would ecigs and ejuice get to be excluded?  Any industry with the possibility of harming the user, and let's face it, ecigs although extraordinarily safe compared to regular tobacco products can cause harm through the nicotine in them.  What grounds do we have as vapers to denied the public the peace of mind of a FDA or whomever stamp of approval.  A truly unbiased, uninfluanced by lobbyists, comprehensive study on the issue would be hard to conduct but unless the government is aloud to do what they were designed to do, protect it's citizens from danger, this battle will continue.  The way I see it, without proper cooperation from ecig companies and vapers themselves, if there needs to be any, the governing body's will be forced into action by the people who line their pockets with mostly ungrounded rhetoric and will base their studies on big tabacco's data and their own, swaying their studies in favor or heavy regulation which will ruin the chances of small scale juice companies making it if government organization make it extrealmy difficult for them to become legal killing a new business sector pontecialy worth tens of billions of dollars over the few years.  I don't really know what my point is with anything after my initial question, I guess I just didn't want to sound like an uniformed idiot so I rambled about my prior knolege and for that I apologize but the question remains, what is the argument against regulation the vaping industry?", 'The argument isn\'t *against any regulation*, in fact I believe that most of the responsible vendors and vapers are in favor of regulation.  \n\nThe problem is creating **sensible** regulations.  Things like child-proof caps on eliquid, 18+ sales only are good for the industry to legitimize it.  However, the regulations as proposed by the FDA will essentially destroy the industry as we know it, effectively killing small businesses and competition.  \n\nIf these regulations go into place as-is, the "cig-a-like" closed systems will be the only products available to the market, and Big Tobacco will have been given a monopoly on the industry as they are the only companies that have the resources to comply with the multi-million dollar (per product) approval process.', 'No one objects to some regulation for public health and safety. That unfortunatley is not what these regulations address and what they do address is market share. The majority of the vaping industry is regulated out of business. ZERO. \n\nThis is not a doomsday scenario. Even the OMD Economic Impact Report projects the market of up to 500k products will be reduced to 25 and those that remain could require up to a million dollars each to stay. \n\nThe SBA wrote up a detailed letter on how damaging these regulation are and many of them violate fair business practices. \n\nFrom a public health perspective, there is little doubt that smoking rates would climb again. Among several large reviews, there has been no evidence that vaping is attractive to kids who don\'t smoke. If they were a "gateway" then smoking rates would have seen an increase as the addiction increased and instead it\'s been the opposite result; smoking rates, across all age groups, have never been lower. \n\nVapers are ex-smokers. There is no love of tobacco companies. We know they snuck in additives to make cigarettes more harmful and addictive. We don\'t want them to do that with vaping too. \n\nIt makes no rational sense to turn this industry over to the very same people that were responsible for the MSA to begin with.

This community is full of shitheads and douche bags, and you\'re most likely one of them. I know I was. The amount of bragging and overall fuckery in this community is worse than a damn college frat. No one cares how low your build is. No one cares how big your cloud is. No one cares how expensive your rig is. You spent 300 dollars on a metal fucking tube so you can stroke your dick about how far you can chuck your cloud. Congratulations. Too bad you can\'t put that on a resume. I\'ve never met a bigger collection of self entitled morons and conventions are the worst of all. There isn\'t even a game to it anymore. It\'s just walk up to a vendor and say "what can I have for free?" and when someone tells you no, you give them a bad review. Fuck you if you do that. You\'re an entitled shithead and no better than a god damn toddler. People have to work for a living. I know this is a strange concept for a lot of you, but that\'s how the world works.\n\nI started vaping as an alt to cigarettes. \n\nIt turned into a hobby. I like the thought of cloud chasing and I enjoy spending money on my hobbies. I can\'t put my 18-19 years of gaming on a resume either, and can barely justify the literal THOUSANDS I\'ve spent on gaming if I can\'t justify the few hundreds I\'ve spent on vaping. As with any hobby, there are the self-entitled folks who only think of themselves. I haven\'t met anyone, personally, who actually gives poor reviews for the lack of free things. I won\'t deny they exist, though, and I agree... fuck you if you do that.\n\n> I see these kids day in and day out. They work minimum wage at Dominos and vaping is their whole life. They think they can just start a juice company and be lazy fucks their whole life. It\'s so fucking pathetic. No drive, no ambition, no college, no tech school, no desire to do anything besides post that next insta video so they can get sponsored. Which brings me to my next point, sponsorships and cloud comps. I watched this community change from friendly cloud comps where the winner gets a bottle of juice to cutthroat competitions where the winner gets 10k, yes literally 10k, I\'m not being hyperbolic, and the competition ends in physical altercations and actual resentment between groups of people. Over a fucking cloud comp.\n\nThose kids exist in any hobby and will be existent until the lazy is called out. Wanting to start a juice company is cool, and how things start happening. Also, about the comps... I haven\'t been in the scene for more than 4 or 5 months, and I most certainly haven\'t been to a single comp that didn\'t take place between me and my friend at his place, winner getting free pizza dinner. I do agree, 10k is a bit overboard for a hobby that involves breathing something in and exhaling. There is no argument that, that\'s just dumb. However, you could almost compare the hobby comps to that of car audio comps. It costs a good bit of money to get in, and the rewards need to match. 10k is still overboard.\n\n> Shops, vendors, machinists, everyone in the community who is a part of this "sponsorship" only perpetuates this mentality. I get it though. It\'s cheap advertising. It\'s playing on the stupidity of this community to push your own product. I can\'t count the number of companies who make shit or overpriced products but are insanely popular because they got what\'s-his-dick (or what\'s-her-dick) to post an insta video for them. The worst part about it though? The people in this community are too stupid to look at a product objectively and make their own decision about it.\n\nI agree there is a lot of this going around. Personally, I see even one person praise a company, just on this sub, and I go to their site and compare prices. If their prices are fair, I try \'em out. This labor day I purchased nearly 500ml of juice from several different places. We\'ll see where it goes. I have no argument on this. People really need to figure out what is good for themselves. \n\n> You want to government to take you seriously? You want to avoid regulation? You want to "save vaping." So stop acting like a bunch of god damn children and clean up your act. This community has a victim-complex as bad as SJW\'s on tumblr. No one takes you seriously because of your own actions. It\'s not a great conspiracy to end vaping, it\'s much simpler than that. Vaping is taking money away from a great deal of industries and it\'s easy to attack this market because it consists almost entirely of morons and fools.\n\nI personally hate reading this one, you\'re just being cynical here. It doesn\'t matter the reason for vaping, the reason to chase better juice and mods, the need for higher/lower nicotine levels. If you\'re a vapor, you want vaping to succeed. The government is stopping this in *some* areas around the US (I\'ll leave other political issues for those who know more). In my own area, PA Governor Wolfe wants to add a 40% tax to all vaping gear and supplies. In other areas, the taxes are being put out and regulations are hitting hard. I forget where, but there is already an area where B&M stores are close to needing to move/close because of the regulations of the juice makers needing licenses and security. I wouldn\'t say the majority of this community is running on a victim-complex. We\'re defending something we enjoy, love, and do. We aren\'t getting into moral battles with anyone. However, this is for anyone else.... never fight a moral battle over vaping. If someone disses the vaping scene, so be it. \n\nThat\'s all I got. I\'m not arguing or debating you exactly, just adding into the conversation with what I see and believe. \n\nI\'m sorry you wound up feeling this way.', '>The people in this community are too stupid to look at a product objectively and make their own decision about it.\n\nThis is my biggest problem. People either tell you "do the research" to which you find there is a nominal amount (from an academic point of view). Transparency is lead by **outrage** and PR hand waiving. This industry makes me actually embrace government regulation, which is not a position I\'m in very often--especially insofar as the woefully corrupt and underemployed FDA.\n\nBig Tobacco got a lot of shit for its deceptive marketing, but I\'m not sure I find Vaping much better. Something being LESS of a risk is good, but unless you know HOW MUCH LESS, it\'s difficult to call it SAFE. Everyday, I recommend vaping less and less because of the e-juice landscape.

I simply just go to my local smoke/vape shop, pick up the same few varieties of juice i always do in 24nic and walk out.

If I may rebut.\n\nYour blanket statement is exactly the type of thing that SJWs would write. I find it rather odd that you are writing this in an angry sense against "Vapeholes" yet are acting like one. Where I live, and go to school, there are many kind hearted vapers, many of whom are good friends of mine. We swap liquids, offer each other to test our current bottles, and see what is out there that we like, instead of puffing on the same liquid day in and day out. We also do things other than vape together. A majority of my friends who vape are also my rock climbing friends. \n\nSpeaking of r/climbing, That subreddit has very little, if any at all, with climbing and toking up. What I personally enjoy is that my vape/climbing friends found vaping specifically to get away from the trees lifestyle. Personally I\'m almost completely clean (once a month max) while most of my friends are completely clean and sober. So it\'s as much a tool for us as it is enjoyable. Oh! and we pay for our liquids like every one else in our town. We gladly support a plethora of local shops, with no expectation of free anything, or sponsorships, etc. \n\nAdditionally, the local shops are super nice! I have only found one shop that I have had an issue with, and even then it wasn\'t worth bashing their business. I just try to go elsewhere. Shop owners and employees have always been willing to answer questions, offer taste tests of liquids people may be interested in purchasing, and don\'t push so hard that we feel obligated to buy a bottle. In fact they don\'t push to make us feel obligated at all! I have taken both of my mods into my favorite shop, and both of them have been asked about, and that was that. No "Hey, wanna buy this God box?" Just a simple acknowledgement of the device, perhaps a personal opinion of the mod from experience. But that\'s it. End of story.\n\nAs far as a respect side of things? I feel like that may be a regional thing. I rarely, if at all, see people vaping in public buildings here.

We can't really do any tricks and we don't really care, we compare mods but not as a way to measure dicks but to say 'this is mine and I like it cause of X Y and Z. Can I see yours?'.

Worse, currently you are being told to be happy you have a job at all, even if the entire world looks down on you for "only" being dominoes minimal wage. These people still want to be good at something, want to be respected and taken seriously. They are very unlikely to get there via their main job, so they stick everything into their hobby. They can make 15k that way? Good for them! May be that can PAY for that education you are tooting so highly! They can get sponsorship? This is no longer a hobby, this is a way out of that minimal wage job! This IS their ambition! Yeah, that means less relaxed atmosphere for us hobby vapers, but may be we should count out blessings that we don\'t have to run for that win as an exit ticket from the life we hate. May be we should accept that by doing well, vaping has become big business. The same has happened to countless other hobbies and those hobbies are still alive and well. They had to adapt. Vaping is still new, it will have to adapt a lot. Cigarette smoke used to be blown up people\'s butts as a medical procedure. I\'m sure vaping will survive sponsorship. \n\nCrap, now I have wasted my life right back. \n\nTL;DR: You are an unpleasant and very entitled person.

MCT oil. Like that won\'t give you lipid pneumonia. Vaping oil. They\'re all over the place. And people who use them probably won\'t test positive for THC. It\'s a bit naive of the CDC to assume people will just \'fess up to buying and using black-market THC carts. Especially where THC carts are illegal, period. I hope they tested the people claiming they only vaped nicotine for THC. I\'m not sure if they have that authority. But, really, who volunteers to a bunch of federal investigators they\'ve been using a federally-illegal drug bought out of the back of a truck. Especially when they know the next question is absolutely going to be, "Who/where did you buy them from?" because the CDC has to trace the supply chain?\n\nAlso, people have been vaping e-liquid for 15 years now.  Why a sudden outbreak now of up-to-lethal lung disease? Nothing has changed about e-liquid\'s basic ingredients to trigger a sudden epidemic. Why no epidemic in Great Britain, where vape shops are opening in hospital lobbies? (However you feel about government-supplied healthcare for all citizens (or residents, or whoever can use the NHS\'s services) is that when a country\'s elected government has to pay for everybody\'s health problems, they are a lot more willing to fund research--and listen to it--into the actual-public health utility of vaping to get people off cigarettes. Smokers die slowly of it and get sick from non-lethal chronic illnesses before half or 2/3 of them die of it. The government has to pay the enormous cost of their collective illnesses and hospitalizations for pneumonia and heart attacks and all the nasty stuff cigarettes cause in regular smokers. No tobacco lobby can pay the government off anywhere near enough to cover the price it pays in extra healthcare, lost productivity, etc. Which comes out of every taxpayers\' pockets. They\'ll get voted out of office if the NHS gets overburdened with preventable illnesses, so they do try to prevent them. Though I don\'t think any democracy has the ability to ban cigarettes; people seem to feel entitled to the things; but they can recommend vaping as a much safer alternative when Johnny Smoker gets his first cloudy lung x-ray.)\n\nI did a fellowship at the CDC, and they\'re actually good people. But they are used to epidemics being caused by viruses or contaminated food or something that only sickened, say, people staying in one particular hotel. (That was a real case they solved. Turned out to be contaminants spread via the hotel\'s HVAC system, i believe.) Anyway, the scientists are middle-age-ish and live in Atlanta; they are NOT prepared for an epidemic caused by a change in thickeners used to make thinned-out (cut) THC oil look right again. I doubt they read Leafly articles. A ton of catching up to do on what people vape, how, and even that the typical cartridge battery + THC (or CBD) cartridge is not how people vape e-liquid. As for Juul pod systems, i wouldn\'t quite put it past Philip Morris to adulterate e-liquid pods on purpose to kill off the e-cigarette industry. No I have no evidence and yeah that seems like a stretch; but, really, we\'re talking about people whose main product causes 1 in 5 American deaths. And was deliberately made much more addictive than plain nicotine. Are they willing to kill people? Uh, well, considering they are in the coffin-nail, death-stick industry that serves no legitimate need, obviously yes. Mind you, I\'m not claiming they did any such thing. just meditating on their collective mindset based on the indisputable fact that their products uselessly kill their customers, they know it, and they made it as hard as possible for the latter to quit using their products.

Different combinations of flavor out there in our world have to been combined for the vaping experience than the ones we\'re used to. Best example I could give regarding this is boba bounty. Yes it\'s an old juice, yes it had its momentum, but whatever you liked or disliked it people were unable to unanimously describe it.

d1lgor|*|Vapewild has broken my spirit|*|['Hey all!\n\nThis does suck. Honestly though, I\'ve vaped Amaizeballs (with a few drips of butterscotch flavoring) for the last few years. The unfortunate truth though is that Amaizeballs is not in the vault. It, with a few other flavors, have been permanently discontinued. And like so many other things going on right now, you have the FDA to thank for that. For those of you wondering why, read on.\n\nFlavor manufacturers such as Capella, Flavor West, Flavour Art, and so on change their flavor recipe from time to time. This is why you often see V1 and V2 flavors from many of these brands. In some cases, they introduce a V2 and discontinue the V1, as has happened in the case of Amaizeballs, Moco Coco Loco, and others. There are a myriad of reasons that a manufacturer\'s flavorings change - a certain component is no longer available so they find a new supply, there was an unintended result of the original formula, they simply wanted to make it even better - the list goes on. But in all of these scenarios the result is a "new" flavoring being created.\n\nThe reason that this is such a problem for vaping is because we, as manufacturers, have had to submit all of our recipe info to the FDA, and, once done, we are not allowed to change it. Each recipe is submitted to them with corresponding "CAS" numbers ([Chemical Abstracts Service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAS_Registry_Number)). The numbers indicate (layman\'s terms here) the chemical make-up of a substance, in this case, flavoring. When a manufacturer creates a V2, this results in a new CAS number, and, if the V1 is discontinued, then we\'re just out of luck.\n\nTL;DR - flavor manufacturer changes a recipe, FDA says we cannot use new recipe in our recipe, and now it\'s just a recipe for disaster\n\nLegit, I wish it didn\'t go down like this. You should have seen my face slide off onto the floor when I found out Amaizeballs was to be no more.', 'Thanks for swinging by to confirm what i was saying.

dycvds|*|So, realistically, is VapeWild going out of business, or what?|*|["Just want to step in here and address this again. As far as we all know here, we are not going out of business anytime soon. The specific concerns you've addressed may feel indicative of a closure but the reasons we have provided in the past are still legitimate. Regarding the flavor discontinuance that we went through recently - we are preparing for the PMTA submission process and flavors were eliminated for this reason. Many different factors afffect the decision to eliminate a flavor from our menu. For example, certain flavor concentrates that we have used in the past to make popular VW flavors are often changed on an ingredient level by the manufacturer. Due to the level of consistency that is demanded by the FDA process we are no longer able to rely on that concentrate as it would qualify as a change of ingredient. If you want a more in depth description of this, we've addressed it in a previous post on here about the discontinuance of our Amaizeballs flavor. This posed no issue in the past, however due to the monetary cost of a single PMTA (upwards of $117,000 to around $466,000), it is no longer feasible at all for any e-liquid provider, even one of our size.\n\nThis brings up another important factor that has resulted in less flavors being available. With the potential cost of a single PMTA application, there is no way that we could afford to move forward with all 150 flavors that we originally provided - one of the most overt reasons why we had to begin our elimination process. The cost also addresses our approach to what mg/ml and vg/pg ratios we have flavors available in, as a change in vg/pg or ml/mg qualify as a change of ingredients under the PMTA guidelines and will require separate applications.\n\nWe're aware that we are in the minority when it comes to vaping businesses adjusting their practices in preparation of the PMTAs and that it may look like we are jumping the gun. However, it has always been VW's practice to be the early bird with this sort of thing. In fact, I would go as far to say that a company that has not made any adjustments to their business practices is most likely not planning on being around after PMTA or has so few products that there is no need for adjustments. What we did not anticipate and take preemptive measures towards was the recent painting of vaping in the media or reactionary government policies that followed over the last couple of months.\n\nTo address the flavors that we still provide being out of stock lately, we had a supply chain issue this past month that resulted in a number of stock outs. You should see this improve soon as we fill those again.\n\nIn summary, our gameplan has always been to do what it takes to make it to the otherside of this and from an internal perspective,  I continue to see this approach still.", 'Sad for us vapers in the hell this uncertainty has brought.  Sadder still for the position it has put businesses like you in. \n\nThank you for all you have done for the vape industry and continue to do. I hope your adjustments will keep you in business! The unknown of what may come must keep you all awake most nights. All the best to you!!!!', "Are you planning on keeping the unflavored base liquid around?  Your juices seem to have something different going on in the base than anyone else's I try, and I think it must have something to do with the quality of your base.  According to my account history, I've been placing regular orders with you since June 2015, and I'd love to keep you as my juice supplier, but you've discontinued every flavor I like.

Maybe another bottle will end better. ', 'I didn’t like this flavor at all when it first came in and wasn’t steeped. Way too much melon. It seemed to mellow out a bit after a while and then I ended up vaping the whole sample over my weekend and really liked it. A lot of them are good right when they come in. I actually liked surf cake better when I first got it, after a couple weeks all I could taste is the graham cracker crust flavoring and it’s just too much now. Steeping is a tricky game!', 'Why does it have cantaloupe and apples on it ', 'Because its a Honeydew and Cantaloupe flavor mixed with hints of apples and pear!']

These are crazy times we’re living in, and they just keep getting crazier. Our sincerest hope, though, is that we have somehow made a difference in the world for the better over these last six years.\nYou’ll probably see emails from other places over the next few weeks with words like “it is with a heavy heart” or “with our deepest regrets”, etc. But we don’t have a heavy heart or any regrets. We did the best we could and sure enjoyed the heck out of sharing it with all of you. It’s been the greatest roller coaster ride any of us have ever been on, and it is with our sincerest thanks that we write to you. We wish you the best on your vape journey!\nThank you for coming along with us on this wild ride. <3 \nYou are the Best, VapeWild Fam!\n-- VapeWild”', "Thanks for the memories guys.

Am gonna miss y'all", 'This really sucks, they were a favorite company of mine. Hopefully they release their recipes or something', 'I totally agree. Main company I buy ejuice from, guess I’ll buy local', 'Why is there no outrage about this? Why is no one willing to hold this rule up in court?', 'Lots of small businesses going up against big tobacco companies, and the government itself. That mixed with the whole bs argument that "vaping is targeted at children cause no adult wants to go around vaping fruits and candy flavors"... Means that the fight is not easy. It will be long and difficult and unlikely to win in any significant way for these businesses before they close. \n\nSo it has been fun, but looks like the best thing to do is stock up, cut back, and quit if you can, or start paying to suck that big tobacco dick.', 'So bummed!!! This company was the best!', 'What does this all mean ? Will this mean getting vape juice will be impossible?', "Out of the loop on this what's happening", "FDA is putting the hammer down. PMTA applications are due September 9th, it's an incredibly expensive process to apply (millions of dollars). Many companies are chosing to simply close on that day.\n\nIt applies to juice, hardware, coils, pods, etc... Only a handful of companies have applied so far, even less have had thier applications accepted (which buys them an additional year). I believe only one so far has been approved if I recall, and it's a big tobacco backed proprietary sealed pod system.\n\nSo unless you're going to quit the general consensus is stock up on basically everything. If you can DIY or know someone who can DIY for you that would be the best option. There's also currently a nicotine tax bill that will make getting bulk nicotine for DIY very expensive, It has yet to pass the Senate or the house though.\n\nThere is also a bill to ban sending vape related items through the US postal service.

Undoubtedly you may yet be forced to discontinue or rename other liquids, can you show us that going forward it will not be without warning soon after you learn something like that is to happen? \n\nDo you feel that it might be prudent to also have a page dedicated to listing discontinued liquids and also liquids that you have renamed, reflecting both their previous names and the new one?

eq7irw|*|Addressed 1000x, Yes, But I'm Still Frustrated|*|["I get it. Just the other day I was looking for a strawberry  cotton candy that I had gotten back in april and now I couldn't find it", 'Yep, similar story with me. Washington passed a flavor ban back in October ‘19 which prevents me from buying pre-flavored juice, though we can still buy non-flavored and add concentrates to it... And done in the back room of a shop instead of just buying my bottle and being on my way. Much sketchier now than it was before the flavor ban, but the mass propaganda won this battle. Luckily I live right on the border to Oregon which rescinded their flavor ban. \n\nAnyway, so since I was SOL for about 2 months on buying juice any less than a 30 minute drive away, I checked the site and saw it was BARE. Like, actually dry as a bone with all of my favorites done and dusted, so I’ve since had to shop around. There are absolutely great flavors out there to choose from, don’t get me wrong, but this feels like having a favorite Limited-Time item from a fast food joint. They carry it for a while but once it goes away it’s usually gone for good (Rest in peace, McDonald’s Bacon Smokehouse burger).', "I agree. Whoever came through and bought VW fuct it all up!! Everything became trash. I used to buy a boatload of Juice monthly and things changed in or around August or September. I love their Pear of melons and I can still get it but I'm doubting their quality. I even have money saved up on my rewards but I haven't bought from then since they went under. It's a shame really enjoyed the customer service it was a model for CS, honestly. Enjoyed my shipments and the personal touches like you mentioned. Smh I don't trust em to put another order in but damn I miss the few really good juices I'd get from them.", "I'm also frustrated. I went to buy my favorite menthol flavors and could only get one of my four flavors in 12mg. Could only get that flavor in a pg/vg blend that I never buy, and only in 30ml. I hate to say it but I'm going to have to try to find another vendor and pay twice as much. I was a loyal VapeWild customer for months but I just can't get what I'm looking for from them anymore it seems 😞"]

How did you curb weight gain? I knw a lot of people who never gained anything when they quit, and others who did. i'm on day 3 of no vape, awful brain fog, stomach cramps and irritability, but no weight gain that i can tell yet. Full disclosure, if i do gain weight then i'd probably go back to it, which is ridiculously vain and stupid, but it could happen. So far i havent been eating more though", 'You’re most welcome, I’m glad that it was helpful! \n\nRe weight gain, I am also very vain so I totally get it. I was so worried about this. In truth I did put on a little weight (others didn’t notice it but I’ve always been very petite, so I did) as I was eating so much just to fill that horrible empty feeling. I didn’t weigh myself but I could just tell by looking in the mirror that my body was a bit different looking. \n\nWhat helped me though was really upping my exercise routine - both to improve my lung health after trashing my poor little lungs for so many years, and to balance out the additional calories. Exercise has been my single biggest saviour in this whole journey. \n\nI’m now 138 days vape free and my body is the best it’s ever been as I’m working out so much more than I ever did as a smoker/vaper. \n\nI would really encourage you not to give up if you gain a little weight. Quitting is so, so worth it and you can always lose the weight once you’re out the other side, or do what I did - up your exercise routine and it should balance out. \n\nNothing is more important than ditching the nic!', 'wow all of these hit so close to home!!! i’m 6 days in with no vape, feels amazing.', 'Well done! I wrote this at 70 days. I’m now 142 days and I feel even better again - I could add another 30 points to this list. It gets better and better.

I went through a very similar experience. Went a month cold turkey off of vaping. Those first couple of days kind of suck, but after the initial hump I felt a lot better, and as the days went on my cravings got less and less. After that month I was going to watch football with some friends. A couple of them vape, and I thought “you know what, I’ll just buy a disposable to use while I’m hanging out with them, and then I’ll get rid of it afterwards.” Then I decided maybe I could just keep it, and only use it while I’m hanging out with them. Now, I’m back to vaping just to feel “normal” again. \n\nI literally just bought a 4 pack of pods, and felt like shit for doing it. I typed in quitvaping into Reddit figuring there’s a subreddit for it, and this is the first post I clicked on.

As of now, 11/2/2022 at 6:00pm. I've taken the first step in beginning my journey to quit vaping. How did I get here? Well it started with the very last bottle of juice. Not the good stuff juice. That bottle you find hidden away long ago cause you didn't like it at the time. Desperate to finally end the vape cycle but still hooked. That only bottle left to ease the crave. Down to the last coil that is nearing burnt. Holding onto the mod that you've owned for the last 4 years that no longer keeps the charge. All arrows pointing to either you crack to buy new setup or you hold your ground on quitting. Let's be honest here. A new setup can be pricey. A new mod. New coils. New bottles of juice. Everything under the sun is expensive right now. I can't justify spending money on an addiction that isn't helping me and is making life actually worse. Money that can go towards better things in my life. On top of that. I know vaping isn't good for my health. I know it's affecting my gums and teeth. Which is another motivation to quit. I have to do this for my health. I've been vaping for the last 8-9 years. Before the vape I smoked cigarettes. I know at one point in my life I didn't smoke cigarettes nor vaped. I know I can be free from it. I have to try my best to break the habits. If anyone has any advice that would be appreciated. I was told eating sunflower seeds can help ease craving. I'm really dead serious about quitting. I'm also concerned. I live with others who vape. I'm worried seeing them vape will trigger me back into it. Hearing the vape. Smelling and seeing the clouds. This is probably the biggest factor of the challenge. I can't really escape the vape around me right now. I know this is going to be hard and it's going to suck. I'm going to hold myself accountable each day and try to stay positive. Remind myself why I'm doing this. How this is going to benefit me going forward.", 'Sunflower seeds are sold either in the shell or as shelled kernels. Those still in the shell are commonly eaten by cracking them with your teeth, then spitting out the shell — which shouldn’t be eaten. These seeds are a particularly popular snack at baseball games and other outdoor sports games.', "I too quit 11/2/22 at 6:00. I know because I decided to throw my disposable along with my delta-8 vape as well out of my car window on my way home last night. I am literally writing this from a gas station parking lot that I've been sitting in for at least 20 minutes now. Trying to tell myself not to go in. After reading this post and now your comment I think I'll go home. But I know it won't be long until I'm back here, trying to make the same decision again. Maybe together we can do it. I'm just so angry and irritable right now. I don't see how I can make it honestly.", 'Saved. Unbelievable. Day 114 was heavily considering going back, but I’m going to hold off. Itching to sacrifice it all for “FIVE SECONDS OF PLEASURE” Thank you', '177 days no nic. Come back to this post every so often I have an intense craving. (Like now) .

Throughout the 7 or so years of vaping, it was mainly weekly use. Only on vacations would I vape daily. I decided to drop it completely because I did a lot of research on the harmful effects and it was detrimental to my mental health. It lead to a lot of anxiety and mood problems. Before last year, I was in the process of quitting so I was doing it every few months. Eventually I had enough and wanted to change. The first few weeks were definitely the worse. Mood problems, anxiety, some insomnia, but I did other activities like working out and spending time outside to push through. At around the 3 month mark I finally started to feel OK again. I was able to regulate my emotions and I was a lot happier with life in general.

Couldn't agree more.\n\nI had the same experience as you, vaped for 5+ years, quit after feeling the way you've described and listening to Allan Carr's book. I'm now 142 days 'nic free'.\n\nFull context - I have relapsed a few times on weekends/nights out. But now that I've seen the absolute slavery of dependence for what it is, I've had zero desire to go back to full daily use after any relapses.\n\nIt's a mentality shift, and it sounds like you've got it! Congrats on quitting.", 'I relapsed after 68 days after drinking beer and didn’t have too much of a hard time carrying on as usual the next day too. I’m not sure I seen it as a “I’m in control of nicotine it’s not in control of me” moment though. Ultimately I still smoked that night, to me it opened my eyes to how addictive it truly is. I still risked it all by smoking, any time I relapse I risk losing it all. If I was truly in control I’d just not smoke ever, I wouldn’t play with fire and push my luck. That’s my opinion and how I look at my relapse anyway.', 'I’ve listened to that book as well and it REALLY helped me. I’m day 8 now and I honestly want to rip my head off cause I can’t focus. the thoughts in my head are an absolute mess.', "Thanks for sharing this.  It reminds me alot of the olden days.  Although probably too young to remember, there was a time when we smoked EVERYWHERE, when secondhand smoke concerns weren't yet a concern.  Smoking was the norm inside everyone's house.  We smoked in bed, at work, in restaurants, concerts, football games, while pushing a cart and shopping in the grocery store.  I made 7 cold war submarine patrols and at least half the crew smoked.  About the only place smoking wasn't permitted was when pumping gas. \n\nThe more controls society imposed, the less smokers were able to smoke, the more nicotine deprived they became, with nicotine tolerance levels (cigs per day) ever so gradually declining, except for the self-employed or few jobs that allowed smoking.  My own boss and smoking three packs-a-day, the day before I quit I was lighting a new one every 15 minutes from dusk to dawn, a pack for the morning, the 2nd by noon and the 3rd by dinner.\n\nAs for nicotine intake comparisons, while relatively easy for science to establish that the average smoker introduces roughly 1mg of nicotine per cigarette smoked and that the average smoker smokes 15 cigs per day, as you note, vaping has no defined stopping point.  On here you read about folks holding their vape in their hand as they sleep and an entire ElfBar being consumed in a day.\n\nWith so many juice nicotine concentration variations, it makes intake comparisons a nightmare.   Instead, we [see vaping studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7668279/) focus on factors such as the average number of puffs per day (365 for the average POD/tank user), weekly e-liquid consumption (median: 32.5 mL/week), and the nicotine concentration vaped (median: 3 mg/mL).", 'I have seen so many of your comments, and would like to thank you so much for imparting your wisdom on all of us.

It's pretty awesome and I hope you can stick to it.", 'Absolutely. This is embarrassing but I switched back to cigarettes before quitting because cigarettes force me to slow down the intake and I become disgusted with them and the smell and the feeling. The first few days back on cigarettes, I was literally going through withdrawal while still smoking as many as I wanted. My body had to adjust back to good ole fashioned tar-in-the-lungs nicotine rather than the cross-the-blood-brain-barrier nicotine salt chinese space drugs they put in Elf Bars.

It was good to make it less convenient.   \n\n\nNot making any recommendations here because everyone is different, but this helped me.', 'This makes a ton of sense.

Reading a book. Taking a bath.

You can come close with nicotine salts but that’s a little tough.

Sure - it\'s "healthier" than smoking burnt tobacco leaves/carcinogens from a cig, but the levels of nicotine consumed and the frequency of intake from vaping is FAR higher than that of smoking cigarettes.\n\nYou wouldn\'t chain smoke a bunch of cigs in your bedroom all day or sneak in a puff while you\'re sitting in your office (or maybe you would), but you would with a vape; much more frequently due to the lack of odor, stealthiness, and convenience  - constantly increasing the levels of nicotine in your body and cravings for nicotine.\n\nIn fact, many people who previously did not smoke are now vaping with a heavy addiction (me, for example, and I hate myself for it)! \n\nThe vape does not leave my-side while I\'m working from home all day, driving, getting ready to go to bed, watching tv....It\'s terrible! I\'ve since switched to only vaping 25mg or lower with exchangeable coils, since the disposable only come in 50mg and I was going thru those like candy.

r1ds8s|*|Over a year clean after 18 years of addiction - Tips from my journey|*|['The “mind games”, The way you described this is so incredibly accurate. Here’s a tip that helped me: learn every trick in the book so you aren’t caught off guard. If you know what your own mind will try telling you to get you to smoke, you’re prepared.\n\nIn the first few weeks, you’re mind will play any kind of trick it can to get you smoking. The mind can be a crafty bugger. Besides trying to trick you into thinking you need it, It will tell you stuff like “see those people over there, look how comfortable they look with a cigarette”.\n\nI actually became “depressed” (for lack of better word) at my first attempt to quit. I don’t believe I was truly sad or anything: was one of the ways my mind tried getting me to smoke. \n\nThat’s the thing: when you cut smoking to the bare minimum of what it is, the thing lasts about 5 minutes and after that 5 minutes.. it’s nothing. You eventually realise that smoking one  wasn’t even worth it. The next one might keep you busy/distracted for a few minutes, but when it’s over.. what now? Smoke another? It’s all so temporary that being trapped in the revolving door is not worth it.\n\nThis is also why vaping is a bitch. You can puff on that thing constantly, all day every day unlike a cigarette which has a start and a finish. My next goal is to quit vaping. While I’m glad I took that as a step to quit smoking, I might have run into a problem of being heavily reliant on a vape.', "Thank you so much.

I'm mostly here reading to see after 2 weeks 0 nicotine I then quit completely and its been 2 weeks without anything, I have this PAIN on my lungs that irritates me, I hope its the lungs starting to heal more and more so trying to see if everyone has that symptom.

I’m so sorry to hear. How long have you quit for? \n\nI went through the trash eating and feeling pretty awful phase for quite some time.

It really stuck with me because it made me realise that quitting is a choice and if I really hated life so much without it, I could start again whenever I wanted. That in turn made me realise that I don’t want to vape, or even like vaping - I’m just an addict.\n\nMaybe remind yourself that if you really feel that vaping enriched your life and you need it, you are free to start again.

10ajlrc|*|a rant about pro vaping subreddits|*|['Honestly I have to stay away from places like those. Part of my quitting is researching all the insidious things behind not just vape companies but also the tobacco and nicotine industry overall. One thing that catches my eyes, is that cigarette producing companies knew for a loooong time how dangerous they were. They hid it for decades. Until someone blew the whistle and they were forced to expose everything and label it as dangerous. It just makes me think, what could these companies producing vapes know that just isn’t shared yet? And considering it is relatively new, what if later down the line when more info is available, it turns out to be unhealthy, similar to the path of cigarettes? I don’t visit those kinds of subreddits, but even on social media as a regular young adult, it’s so hard seeing someone post about how vaping is hurting them and the comments just go on with “im hitting my vape anyway” “lmao ok” and all that.. I just mostly am mad at the companies for duping my generation, which was so close to ending rampant nicotine addiction, into vaping 🙄', 'My biggest concern is if it’s somehow even WORSE than cigarettes…', "Leaving those subreddits has made it easier for me to quit. I'm trying so hard to quit and I'm doing a similar thing as you. Just trying not to be ignorant about it like I was.", 'Like on tiktok. I deleted that cesspool of an app but anytime I saw somebody make a post about wanting to quit nic or something like that, everyone would just be acting negative and saying things like **hits vape**   But that app is mostly teenagers', 'And the insane thing is, the cigarette companies fought tooth and nail to convince everyone that smoking was safe! I was a kid I knew that was bullshit, my grandmother smoked for decades and decades and it wasn’t hard to put 2 and 2 together when it came to her getting lung cancer. But the fact that the cigarette execs were on TV, in a COURT of LAW, saying “our research shows smoking has no impact on health.” With a straight face.Like I bet does! It’s infuriating.', 'Sort off topic but also related . I never had withdrawal when I use to stop smoking cigs. I was a casual smoker? Idk but when I quit vape every single time I had major withdrawals! Vape made me more addictive to nic then cigs because of how accessible it is.

With a vape, it’s a non stop thing all day', 'I was a long time smoker. I didn’t have withdrawals at all. Cravings, yes. But I had major withdrawals these past few days from quitting vapes.', "Yeah ok.\n\nSince I have stopped vaping (just 12 days) I have observed the following:\n\n* I don't get a chesty rattling phlegm cough after eating.

I don't think people realize this and it will soon be recognized as a public health problem.", 'To be fair, that was me, unpopular opinion, but I don’t think it was that terribly hard to quit the salt vapes.

Or is it 5mg?', "The only thing I dislike is that people on the other side act like vaping is just as bad if not worse than cigarettes and it's just not true. No one being honest with themselves ever said it was 100% safe, but it's degrees *safer* than cigarettes are that the attempts to ban it are fucking ridiculous. I believe it legit helps people that have trouble kicking nicotine addiction but want a better alternative. \n\nThat being said, since I've stopped vaping, my chest pain and occasional SOB are gone. The aching pains in my legs and groin are gone. My GERD symptoms have gone way down. My anxiety is so much better and I feel overall healthier in mind and body. I don't have insomnia  anymore either. I was one of those people that chain vaped daily for years. \n\nI think what's needed is honesty, it's hard to know what's the truth when both sides are willing to exaggerate if not outright lie to get their points across.", 'Agreed. Although I’ve been vape free for 2 weeks and only vaped socially, mostly when drinking, my cardio was WAY better when I only vaped compared to when I smoked. No question. Sure vaping isn’t 100% safe but considering you’re not inhaling tar and carbon monoxide, I don’t see how vaping could be considered worse than smoking. \n\nI was never out of breath when using vapes but I was when I smoked cigarettes and tried running. Once I quit smoking, my endurance and breathing improved a lot over time.', 'I don’t think it’s quite known for sure whether it is safer or just as bad', 'Super useful to read this short summation of benefits. TY', 'Can vaping cause leg pain??', 'Vaping is definitely better than smoking but we can’t say it’s healthy. I’d say that the worst part about vaping isn’t even the lung damage but the psychological effects of nicotine addiction', 'I think vaping is more dangerous than cigarettes because it exposes users to way higher levels of nicotine and also appeals to a younger generation of nic fiends who can now sneak rips whenever they want.', "I would think it's better, but honestly can't say for certain. It also may not be an apples to apples comparison in 15 years if side affects are different enough. \n\nI mostly struggle with the nicotine addiction now that california banned the good ejuices. I had to pick up a small vuse from a gas station and realized the vapor isn't what gets me off. It's the nic. I'm probably going to go full-time nic gum soon here, and hopefully can switch to no nic gum after a while of that.", 'It’s easy to understand why there are large communities, like in that subreddit, who hype up and defend vaping. I’m not saying that it is good. There are plenty who turn a blind eye to the health effects.\n\nLike with any addiction, there will be some way to justify it. “\nIt doesn’t contain ___”\n“it’s better than ___”\n“at least I don’t use ___”\n\nTake cigarettes as an example. The reason there are “light” cigarettes? It creates a false sense of choice. The illusion of making the “healthier” choice, blurring that all-or-nothing of something being either good or bad for your health. \n\nBy creating “degrees of risk”, it becomes easier to fall into the trap of thinking you’re making the healthier choice. \n\nAnother example. “Yeah, I have a few drinks every evening… glasses of wine. At least I’m not drinking vodka every night!”. Degrees of risk.

I believe we know the main chemicals in most vapes and how they affect people.  They have been around for around 10+ years so we definelty have some statistical data to rummage in.  We all know it's bad, but it most likely is not as bad as most would assume.  \n\nI'm more worried on salt nic juices getting more potent, and different flavors being used.    Regardless, I'm on the road of quiting as well but it's important to weigh information properly.  \n\nThis isn't even covering how vaping can affect each person differently.  If you have ADHD, I'd imagine this stuff is terrible.  If you have lung or heart issues, you will be quick to blame vapes.   It's all kinds hearsay but best practice is to stay informed and listen to your body.", 'The vaping subs were no help when i was trying to quit. It’s just a bunch of people making the most ridiculous excuses ever and there’s people in there believing it. \n\nThe amounts of salt nic are really ridiculous. I used to use 5% and it done a lot to me and maybe it’s true, it’s technically “better” than smoking but smoking never gave me the problems vaping did. Why i’m not sure. I believe it was because of the high nicotine concentration and all the disposables coming from god knows where. It’s crazy to me how people who have never used any kind of nicotine in their life will start out on 5% salt. My point is that it’s worse than everyone thinks, even tho it’s “better for you”.\n\nAlso, congratulations!', 'That sub is full of COPE.', 'Yeah people there always say "no one has died from vaping". That\'s like saying no one has died from eating a twinkie. It\'s the long term build up that\'s going to hurt you.

And if you die from a heart attack, no ones going to say yup it was that last puff he took.', 'It seems like it’s not anywhere near as carcinogenic as tobacco, so somehow they think it means it can’t be bad. But it has really weird effects when it comes to blood pressure, muscular/joint pain, and even neurological shit. Hell, a lot of people have been X-rayed and show signs of lung scarring, not from aftermarket THC carts, but from just a Juul. I’m pretty worried that a lot of us might end up with emphysema in our old age. Anything that isn’t fresh air is bad for your lungs.', "I will say that the disposables are the biggest offenders when it comes to all of these issues. \nI'm not advocating for people to go out and vape, but I don't know anyone who had any breathing problems from freebase nicotine juice and a refillable system. Misinformation goes both ways, and I do believe vaping can be safer than smoking by a lot.", '[removed]', "I'm not even gonna argue with u over this comment but no not like that", 'They give them out in the hospitals in the UK to help people quit smoking.

I know for myself it was time to quit for my health.', 'Those ppl are sheep.', 'The worst ones are where if someone says they are worried about unknown long term lung impact, there will be these bros saying they juul a pod a day, just got their xrays and their doctors told them they have the lungs of someone 5 years younger, their health checkups go amazing and what not. Just the worst ever. Forget nicotine addiction and its side effects or lungs for a second, my resting heart rate went down like 20 bpm within a month of quitting, and its going down bit by bit still.

Not to hijack your celebration but the image you posted makes a factual claim that needs clarifying. \n\nThe assertion that it takes at least 3 months for "brain chemistry to return to normal" is from a [2016 Psych Central](https://psychcentral.com/news/2016/07/31/dopamine-function-returns-to-normal-3-months-after-quitting-smoking#1) article featuring [Rademacher 2006](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26803340/), a study that compared PET scans of 15 non-smokers to 30 smokers/quitters at **only two points in time**, at baseline (quitting day) and after 3 months of smoking cessation, in estimating the capacity of specific brain regions to synthesize dopamine.  To quote from the discussion portion of the study, "Follow-up scans performed 3 months after smoking cessation revealed that the initially lower K values significantly increased in the left ventral and right dorsal CN and became similar to that of nonsmokers in all regions of interest."\n\nThus, what the study cannot tell us is at what point during the prior 90 days was dopamine availability substantially similar to that of non-smokers.\n\nTo quote the finding from the most detailed dopamine pathway receptor "availability" study ever ([Cosgrove 2009](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2796827/)), while additional receptor downregulation is occurring, "there is **not a significant difference** between β2\\*-nAChR **availability** in smokers **at 2 and 4 weeks** of abstinence **compared to nonsmokers** ..."\n\nThe authors went on to state, "This study is also consistent with a previous study ([Mamede 2007](https://jnm.snmjournals.org/content/48/11/1829.long)) demonstrating that higher β2\\*-nAChR availability in recently abstinent tobacco smokers compared to nonsmokers is temporary. In the previous study in men, β2\\*-nAChR availability decreased to nonsmoker levels in some subjects **by 21 days** of abstinence. Specifically, compared to nonsmokers, smokers had significantly lower β2\\*-nAChR availability at 4 hr of abstinence, significantly higher β2\\*-nAChR availability at 10 days of abstinence, and similar β2\\*-nAChR availability at 21 days of abstinence. Additionally, they reported significantly lower β2\\*-nAChR availability at 21 days of abstinence compared to 10 days of abstinence."', "I've never been good with scientific language.

I don’t miss having to ask my parents for cash under the guise of “in case the restaurant I go to doesn’t accept card” to discreetly buy vapes. I don’t miss being dependent on something that brings no real benefit. I don’t miss the heavy feeling in my throat. I don’t miss the irritated swollen throat I started to get. I don’t miss having an addiction. I don’t miss needing to take hits every now and then. I don’t miss making it my entire personality. I don’t miss having to go upstairs away from spending time with my parents just to take hits in secret. I don’t miss buying counterfeit brands. I don’t miss faulty vapes.', 'As someone who never bought a vape aside from the occasional disposable, I REALLY don’t miss the feeling that I was only hanging out with my friends so I could hit their vape. \n\n\nIt was like every time I wanted to hang out with a good buddy of mine I had this secret ulterior motive. Just chilling with your friend unburdened by that addiction is so much better than the buzz, trust me.', "I was a secret user, too. My husband didn't know. He knew I was a smoker when we met, but pretty lightly so. I quit very easily and picked up vaping during covid lockdown. What a wasteful mistake, and I loathe hiding things from my spouse.

Like you, I hated the sneaking and the bizarrely frequent escapes from family time", 'Well put! \n\nOne thing I really don’t miss is being hungry, but having to wait to get food, then chain ripping my vape so much that I’m not hungry by the time I get food, and as a result, I end up not eating and getting completely wired and jittery.', 'I agree with this. I consciously had to not hit my vape if I was going to a good restaurant because I actually wanted to have an appetite.', "I'm not going to lie I miss the buzz. Plus there is something therapeutic about vaping/smoking, I can't explain it. I also miss the flavors. My coworker is vaping in the office everyday and it smells like delicious granola bar.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlthough I will admit the biggest thing I hated most was getting anxious whenever I couldn't find my mod.", ' The buzz is great.

She had a class where she had to describe the effects of drugs on a person, and she was actually just pulling things out of her own philosophy instead of using a book or bringing in a guest speaker.

I hope things get sorted out but when i was younger and i did get caught i just ended up buying a new one, you should talk to him about how hes too young and maybe it isnt the best choice for him.

g6hqde|*|Nice Salt in Sub-Ohm|*|['the main reason, atleast for me is, you will lose lung capacity. just because you can vape 50mg in a sub ohm tank doesnt mean you shoudl just like in your analogy with the sports car. you can drive fast everywhere you go but you are at a much higher risk of wrecking.  \n\n\nnicotine is not a natural human chemical. it inflames tissue, it is actually labeled as a poison because if you take it in to high of concentrated doses it can cause death, but meh anything is liek that tbh. moderation is key.  \n\n\nif i were you though,  if you were to vape nic salt in a sub ohm tank, i would personally drop it down to 18-24 mg. because with 50mg even i over do it on a mtl device and have lost a little lung capacity. when i talk about lung capacity i mean the amount of oxegen your lungs is able to take in, not the full amount of air you inhale. when you dont have as much oxegen going to yoru body you will cramp and be light headed, especially when you try to stand up or do anything strenuous.   \n\n\nso like i say, i would go down to atleast 18-24mg nic salt if you were to try to vape it on a dl tank. another good idea is to buy juice like smash mouth by humble. they offer this flavor in high strength nic salt and in regular juice. if anything i would take like 3mg and spike it with some nic salts. fill up the tank like 2/3 the way with 3mg then top it off with 35-40mg salts.\n\n&#x200B;\n\neither way, the first thing you should always care for is the health of yourself. if you are not worried about your health then i am not sure why your asking for advice in the first place. good luck and happy vaping!', 'Honestly I am not planning on permanently upping the nic percentage on my juices, I would just like to have the ability on occasion to get a little buzz.

But that doesn’t count for shit) \n\nSo if you have a cigarette or cigar problem juuling might be a good thing for you and can definitely help you while letting you feel your lungs improving but it is still just trading one addiction for another and honestly a nicotine addiction through these 5% pods is harder to quit than cigarettes can be.', "I couldn't take the salt nic, my fucking lungs were constantly tight an I seemed short of breath.

It should not leak nor give you a bad time considering that they\'re one of the leading ecig in the market right now.\n\nHere\'s some Juul pod saving tips I got.\n\nI asked a Juul kiosk personnel just the other day on how to prevent Juul leaks. She told me that you need to keep it up right when storing it. The mouthpiece on top while the colored cap at the bottom. Never put it upside down as the juice will try to escape through the rubber gasket.\n\nI followed her tip and my Juul pods lasted me 2.5 days without leaks.\n\nYou might notice that everytime you wake up, you might see juices splattered all over your pod (happens mostly when the pod is already half-way). You may think these are leaks but in reality these are just the absorbed spit backs that came down from the mouthpiece\'s cotton. Gravity pulled it down.\n\nIf there are juices that leaks into your mouth, roll down a pair of small tissue papers and make paper sticks out of it. Then insert it through the mouthpiece. This will absorb excess juices that were stucked on top of the rubber gasket.\n\nDo not chain vape. Try to give it a few shakes every after 3 to 5 puffs. You may want to check the air bubbles. If you see a "W" shape air bubbles and if the middle part of that "W" looks connected to the mouthpiece. Shake and rotate the pod a bit until the bubble flattens down. That middle part of the airbubble tends to escape through the air hole and might eventually pull the juice inside the pod whenever you puff and it will eventually deposit a lot of excess juice in the mouthpiece.\n\nHope this helps.', 'Bob Robbins is such a strange name.. not necessarily bad, just incredibly weird.', 'What about Rob Bobbins', 'Noob Sibot', '"Robert Robbins" someone\'s parents were sadists.', 'Had a salesman for a company I worked for named Rob Robbins - same.', 'Would this affect the pending ban in NY?', '[deleted]', 'The ban will be ignored by some stores on the lower east side.

d0qn8i|*|a message from tyler, the creator|*|['I read that some of these vape related deaths are from cannabis vape pens. Are these the same incidents? I could see a kid not wanting their parents knowing they smoked pot and blaming it on juul.', 'When it comes to cannabis cartridge or carts the problem is fake carts. Pesticides get into these fake cartridges and can make you ill. I have neger heard of someone dying from a fake cart tho', "Half of them are from laced dab pens and the other half are 14 year olds getting refill pods from their friend but it's the 9th time they've been refilled with some jank ass juice and they're growing mold in the cotton.", 'In THC cartridges (the main thing reported vaped from the patients that are currently sick in the hospital) should only contain distillate and terpenoids which are two normal things to find in THC cartridges. People have been adding Vitamin E acetate because it thickens the oil and the thicker the oil the better people think it is. And when vitamin E acetate is vaporized it turns back into a grease in your lungs causing these effects. But what doesn’t make sense is how a very small amount of people reported this happening after vaping nicotine which shouldn’t ever contain vitamin E. So maybe you’re right about kids not wanting their parents knowing it was THC so they blamed it on nicotine and all of these hospitalized patients are from THC carts', 'https://www.bloomberg.com/amp/news/articles/2019-09-05/vaping-lung-illness-tied-to-cannabis-products-new-york-says\n\nSeems to be stemmed from vitamin E acetate in weed pens. Both legal and non. But you know Juul is going to have a microscope on them', "Whether is weed based or not doesn't matter.\n\nIt's black market carts of either kind that are the problem / causing these headlines.", 'Whats y’alls opinion on all the controversy coming out about lung problems from juul? I’ve been smoking it for over a month now and feel waaaaaay less effects on my lungs when I play basketball or skate than when I smoked cigarettes and I would barley smoke cigs. Like maybe a pack in 2-3 weeks.', 'Well the one major one about the kid who’s lung collapsed, his story got debunked. He had been in the hospital previously for previous lung issues before juul. The other issues were also because of fake, or tampered pods.', 'Try smoking them for 3 years like me..actaully dont i now have shit lungs', 'There’s a lot of articles coming out linking it to vitamin e in knock-off Juul pods and black market THC oils.', 'Every one will have different reactions to how chemicals are consumed with their body’s. Take everything with a grain of salt and use it as a steeping stone vs going cold turkey from smoking.', 'These people that are saying that they are only doing nicotine are straight up lying. Most likely because they live in a non legalized state and they would rather say that they got sick from a legal way than an illegal way. Call them out on their bullshit, people.', "I just got an ad recently on Instagram calling everyone who's ever used a juul while being a minor to file for compensation as being targeted for addiction or something.", 'this is all obviously some trend. all the diseases are linked to weed vapes', '[deleted]', "It's counterfeit dab carts, normal dab carts are fine", "I understand that all these cases come from the vitamin e acetate and fake black market carts/pods, but why are they all coming out right now?  Fake carts and pods have been around for years, and there really hasn't been too much buzz around them, and suddenly there are 450 lung illnesses related to vaping.", 'Tyler, The Creator is a modern musical prodigy of our age - and a master of lyrical prose.', 'my king, I’ll stop juuling for u and only u', "He's trippin out because the lazy lampoons boys were getting his team to endorse the stress balls", 'So, there is little fact out there and a whole lot of misinformation out there. I\'m gonna possibly add to both of these areas.  :D  \n\n\nIt\'s pretty evident, thus far, that Juul is not the perpetrator in these lung illnesses and deaths. But, there is more to this story...Juul is owned by Altria Group, who makes Marlboro. Altria had valued Juul at around 30+ billion dollars in 2018, then invested over 12 billion, now owning 35% stake of the company.   \n\n\nFDA has been full attack mode on e-ciggs since 2017. They have some bullshit numbers showing increase of youth vaping by upwards of 80% etc...pushing most of the blame on Juul, since they control around 60-75% of the non-traditional smokers market. Just to be clear, FDA wanted to ban e-ciggs, but not for safety or health concerns. They started with talking banning menthol cigg flavors, in general (both vape and cigg), including Juul in this attack. At this point, vaping had already exploded.   \n\n\nNow my conspiracy theory (using economic and political theory);   \n\n\nThe FDA alone couldn\'t get the support they needed to push a ban these type of carts. \n\nJuul/Altira/FDA get in cahoots. Juul bows happily to all FDA demands. This "fruity flavor" ban ELIMINATES ALL COMPETITORS that can\'t afford to withstand such a ban. A multi-billion company on the other hand, can stand against such losses, for the short-term. Just to throw it out there, this is usually how monopolies are created, only with help from the state. Monopolies are RARELY created organically and almost always are created with assistance of the government.    \n\n\nNow, this strange epidemic of illicit THC carts comes out of the woodwork. The reason this is so strange is because you would think, unless it was a massive supplier of tainted carts (perhaps an online operation), these tainted cart stories would have been more specific to areas they were created. In other words, lets say 5 illicit cart dealers decide to start spiking their oils with Vitamin E oil, in Los Angeles. It\'s hard to believe that in just the past 6 months, hundreds of illicit cart dealers decide to do the same thing, throughout the nation.  Anyhow, since the FDA could not get the support to push through a ban for the "fruity flavor" ban, this was the cherry on the cake. FDA bounces on it. Hysteria proceeds. Push the ban.', 'Juul can kick back and watch small businesses close up shop. I wouldn\'t be surprised if the FDA continue to push bans onto other non-traditional smoking devices, beyond e-ciggs, including e-juices for cart style vape devices. \n\nThen when all the "science is settled", and they find the juices and whatnot to be safer than smoking, again, Juul will be right back on the market and stronger than ever. They will most likely have a larger stake on the market, when they return, with new products and everything. How conveinent.   \n\n\n@BadVladTheMadLad what do you think?', 'He said kids 😁', '[deleted]', 'juuls aint for kiddos bruh, its for us who formerly smokes 2 packs a day', 'How is this stupid??
