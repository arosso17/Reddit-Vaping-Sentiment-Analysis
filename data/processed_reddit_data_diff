A few weeks later, he just stopped even having that one cigarette.\n\nI went to that shop and they were awesome. It is run by a guy who isn't interested in selling big fancy complicated rigs, he just kept it simple and directed the hobbyists to a different shop, but made his business for people who just want to stop smoking.\n\nIt has been probably three years since I touched a cigarette.

Immediately I stopped smoking actual cigarettes. Within 6 months I was chewing gum. Now 2 years later I haven't had a single cigarette since.\n\nFor me, nothing worked for over two decades until I started using e-cigarettes.

I even passed out briefly at our new years party with a bout of light headedness. \n\nNow, it almost goes without saying, but since making the switch all of those symptoms have disappeared. Not only that but my health has made a huge rebound - I've lost weight since then and I've been able to go to the gym and work out, which was impossible before with my wheezing and gasping and massive blood pressure problems. \n\nIt's impossible for me to overstate this - I am so incredibly thankful that my wife convinced me to give e-cigarettes a try. I don't even want to imagine what would have happened to me if I hadn't made the switch and I heartily recommend it to anyone reading this thread and wishing that they could quit smoking but had failed multiple times like I did.

If you maintain normal smoker\'s etiquette with the vape, you will have no problems. Abuse of that etiquette by douchenozzles in flame shirts is how this lovely advancement got a bad rap. \n\nThis is the one thing I, a middle aged man, am angry at millennials about. Why could you, of all people, not be cool. Why. And stop making Youtube videos about it. Only the dorkiest of Cigar Aficionados made a hobby about tobacco. That was one of the things that made it cool. Nobody actually nerded out about it. You just smoked, all casual. It looked poetic between a lady\'s fingers, and was associated with suffrage. Edward Munch made a point to paint himself [holding one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iu2L7oA9QRg).\n\nDrawbacks. The vape is not cool. It just isn\'t. It doesn\'t LOOK cool. I once had somebody laugh at me for "sucking on the robot dick". Ain\'t nothing free. The main benefit of the cigarette is its slender profile, its poetry, it\'s association with fire. One can talk about breathing the air of hell. \n\nBut. Smoking is not cool. The kids don\'t smoke, these days. It\'s passe. Pretty girls (and lovely boys) didn\'t smoke much before, and now they really, really don\'t. The vape will not make your kiss taste like an ashtray. So even though the vape is a bit lame, well, smoking is even more lame. Those who are inclined to live and let live about vaping, despite its weird rep, will have real and understandable reasons to despise you if you continue to smoke. As I say, keep your smokers etiquette intact, and non-vapers will only comment on how lovely you make their world smell.\n\nIf not for some a-holes trying really hard to be fedora cunts and spoil it, the vape conjures the dream of smoking, rooms full of artful fog, but when the non-smoker walks into this fog, it smells like cherries, or butterscotch, not grimy tobacco. Frankly, you will not enjoy the flavors as much as they will, as scents. \n\nI cannot recommend the practice enough. Vape. Vape while you still can. \n\nAh. One last drawback. As a smoker, you were used to a cigarette being a cigarette forever, with few changes. But the vape is an electronic device made mostly in China. If somebody could recommend an American manufactured vape, please do, for some will care a lot about that. Like all electronics, vapes are constantly updated. New models and designs are forever being pushed out. The best of the designs stick around for a while, but you will be annoyed by your need to update. However, buy a popular model, and you will be satisfied for quite some time.\n\nAs per DONG_MAGNUM (ffs Reddit) posted, your days are sort of numbered here. They will soon regulate vapes into submission, and in a year, I don\'t know if my advice will be worthwhile. But for now, today, January 1st, there has never been a better time to buy a vape and ditch the smokes. I still fire up a cigarette here and there. I am never happy with it. You too can own this look of satisfaction.\n\nI cannot recommend vaping enough.

I probably tried every other avenue out there, I would quit for a week or month and then relapse and fall down the hill harder every time. First stint with vaping was with one of those cheap little stick mods which I hated. No flavor or throat hit to speak of. I went back to smoking after about 3 days of use for about two years. Got my first sub-ohm around 2013-2014. loved it so at the start, the thing was absolutely amazing. A throat hit to rival a cigarette, I was in awe. But that faded, the flavors I was picking were awful, the upkeep because of the fact that I worked in a production factory was too much, and it started to taste nasty every once in a while. Went back to smoking after about 7 months of vaping. \n\nAfter a few weeks of chain smoking, I noticed a change, a dramatic change. Thing's that tasted delicious before were tasting plain, I couldn't smell anything, I was wheezing, finding it much harder to fall asleep, and there was this noticeable odor around me. I know all of this is common knowledge side effect of smoking, but the fact that the change was so apparent really shocked me. I went back to the vape store and spend probably 200$ on the best vape I could possibly think of and talked for an extended period of time about flavors, that was back in February of 2015. I have not had a cigarette in almost 2 years. feels good man.\n\nMy dad recently started vaping as well, bought one of the little stick mods like I told him not too. Much more successful than me with it but he teetered every week and bought a pack when he was drinking or golfing.

It costs about 120$ for the complete package, I personally started saving money after the second month of vaping. Talk with the guys at the desk about flavors, in my experience, they have been extremely helpful in finding a wide range of flavors that I really enjoy.

It hit /r/all and reminded me that I need to kick this shit for good.", "In my opinion its the only way to quit for a very high percentage of people. Compounding that, other methods can have pretty bad side effects. I was a BIG fucking tobacco user. I regularly used pipes, cigars, RYO, unfiltered, dip, chew, spliffs, dokha, hookah, snus, pouches. I was a tobacco enthusiast. 1+ packs a day. Lots of money. Lots of tar. I've been vaping since before it became a thing. When vapes actually got good and I actually for real stopped using tobacco it was life changing. Sometimes I miss a real cigarette but man if I smoke one now its usually pretty fucking gross. Nothing really beats a dip either when you are working in the shop or on the lawn. I don't even dare try to roll one of my fine fine RYO cigs, rizla papers, amsterdam shag, swan filters. But ecig is pretty god damn good and I've got a gallon of liquid that cost me almost nothing and my gums arent fucked up, I don't smell like shit, I can breathe, I can smell, I can ascend stairs, I don't have the threat of heart and lung disease looming all over me, my clothes don't smell like shit, my car doesn't smell like shit, no ashes, no butts, no rolling down the window in the car even, no going outside in the cold, no yellow walls in my apartment, no burns on my couch, no hole in my wallet. \n\nMy biggest advice is get a good liquid and a good vape from the start. I started out when vapes and liquids were both pretty shitty and then in the middle years when shit could get expensive and frustrating I vaped and smoked or dipped. Thats my second biggest advice, get your good vape AND DO NOT SMOKE. I have one friend that vaped and quit and two friends that do both. I seriously can't even stand a cigarette now especially when I got some big hit of chocolately yummy cool vapor right in my pocket. \n\nAs far as cessation I've only ever seen two people quit that I personally know. My dad did every fucking method; inhalers, gum for YEARS, patches, welbutrin, pouches for years (all have side effects worse than vaping AFAIK). After like 12 fucking years supposedly he quit. The other person I know got a shitty ecig and weened himself down by milligram and quit easy. Literally of all the people I personally know thats it. But then theres me, I love nicotine, I love the oral fixation, I love it with a beer, I love it in the car, and I got three batteries and a big fuckin dripper ready to bang bang. \n\nI started with those weird old clear things marketed on the internet that vaped who knows what. It faded out because it sucked then Blu came out. Tried that bullshit it was okay, or so I thought, kept smoking. Vaped on and off for a few years, mostly with a pen style and an old school 306 dripper. Then slightly more quality mods and more powerful tanks started coming out but they were still kinda frustrating and shitty and expensive. When affordable mods and sub-ohm tanks hit the market I entered the golden age. My first decent ecig when I finally quit was an internal battery 35w mod with a 1ohm coil in a tank. Cost me about $75, and it was kind of a piece of shit. Over the years 32mg, to 24mg, to 18mg, usually $13-$20 a bottle. I currently vape a 3 18650 battery mod that holds up to all kinds of abuse and pumps 200 fuckin watts and I got big fat nichrome juggernaut dual coils totalling .2ohms in a Doge and I'm assblastin 100%VG 3mg clouds that cost me THIRTY FIVE CENTS a bottle. \n\nIf you wanna quit go get a decent $20-$30 mod, sub ohm tank, and play around in the 8mg-14mg range until you don't crave. Wheen yourself off down to 0mg and work on getting rid of the fixation. Keep a bottle of 2mg around for emergencies. If you're like me, just start out with a nice $40-$60 mod - a nice tank - and a nice dripper - fuck the drama - play around in the 4mh-8mg range until you can get down to <3mg, and puff the fuck away. Either way your smell will improve, your breath will improve, if you smoke weed your ass gonna be coughin and takin huge hits and gettin hella high and the weed gonna taste hecka good, you gonna be goin up stairs like a motherfucker. \n\nP.S.

You need to consider the device, the nicotine concentration and a lot of small details like supplies and backups.\n\nYou win a world of flavors, a myriad of devices.

It works very well for most people. I'm probably in a minority. During the time I was vaping, cigs made me gag and I hated them. Vaping is delicious and I miss it. But goddamn, it is inconvenient for me as someone who liked to drip and was a chain vaper. It doesnt have to be like that for you thought. get a tank and a simple mod and try it out. Good luck. ", 'Love vaping. Been 4 years smoke free!', "30 year old here. After thirteen years I've been smoke free since June of this year. Enough was enough. My buddy actually set me up with my first mod and a few coils and different juices after he had quit. At the moment it's in my hetero life mate's head about being that time to give up the cigarettes. I keep telling him that I'd help him out with what he wants and when he wants to do it. Just want to pay it forward. Good luck to all trying to give it up for good!", "Just wanna say this is a great community with awesome people. If you are prone to picking up hobbies this is an amazing one to have. I was one of those people once upon a time that thought vaping was absolutely ridiculous. I always said I'd rather quit smoking all together instead of picking up vaping. However, with an addictive personality it was extremely difficult for me to quit. When I started to research more about vaping I was convinced from all of the Reddit knowledge and gave it a go. I won't lie it took me a few tries to find a set up that worked for me to give up cigarettes all together but I finally found it. Currently on the Ijoy RDTA box. I first started with some Kangetech pens. Moved into an IPV400, migrated to a Wismec Reuleaux 200s. So I did spend some money in those first couple months but after research and playing around I have now found a constructive hobby in building and have quit smoking. After smoking for 9 years I am 100% done with cigarettes. I have been vaping for 5 months now and used to smoke minimum one pack per day. I have saved over $1000 dollars not buying cigarettes. Please give it a try. Start with an expensive set up and see where it goes. Even cutting back does a world of good. \n\nI hope everyone that sets a resolution is strong enough to hit their goal and if you don't succeed the first time around don't become discouraged. As stated it took me a few attempts. Then pens didn't really do it for me but it was a fantastic starting point! Everyone is different and it might work for you. \n\nGood luck and vape on!", 'How safe are the pens ?

Turns out it was because I had tried to go with a cheap-stick style vape, some flimsy $30 gadget.  It wasn't until I dropped $70 on a quality box-mod with adjustable voltage that it finally felt like not just a replacement for smoking, but an improvement.  To those who are interested in trying this, my advice is to be willing to eat the heavier up-front cost of a good device.\n\nBecause once you do...

Had no idea that this subreddit existed. I started vaping not too long ago as a primary hookah/shisha smoker.\n\nSo I guess if any of you visiting here were wondering about this, the electronic cigarette is also more ideal than a hookah/shisha. On average shisha contains around 10-15 mg of nicotine. When I started with the vape, I bought e-juices that are 3mg nicotine and found it very satisfying. The good thing is that it effectively cut down my nicotine intake. Overall it's less work and clean up too. I still love shisha but the vape is definitely more ideal. Also I believe you at least cut out the toxins that come from the coal and such.\n\nI started out with the joyetech starter, the one posted in the sidebar.

Two years no smoking here.", "I smoked for  years, and had innumerable attempts at quitting, using gum, patches, medication, etc with no success. So at some point I had fully accepted that I was either too stupid or weak willed to quit. I accepted that I would smoke until I die.\n\nThen a family member gave me their old vape pen. They had successfully quit and upgraded their device, and thought I should give it a try. I didn't like it at first, which I later discovered was because the nicotine  of the juice was too low to combat my cravings and also I didn't like the flavor.\n\nI started looking online and at vape shops and got better flavors of e liquid for my taste and a higher mgml of nicotine. All of a sudden, I didnt crave cigarettes anymore. I could hardly believe it. As the days went by I fully expected to smoke again, but never did. \n\nThe times when I had cravings to smoke, I was enjoying my Blueberry Muffins or Strawberry Limeade too much to want a stinky cigarette.\n\nNow I have  months smoke free. For someone who had accepted defeat, to have found success is the greatest feeling in the world. Also now I am a member of a community of others who have found similar success and also enjoy the different flavors and devices as much as I do.\n\nWe at SUBREDIT come from all different walks of life, but our common immense gratitude for being smoke free brings us together to support each other and also help share our stories with smokers looking to make the switch.\n\nThanks for reading my story Good luck and Happy New Years", "This post just reminded me that I'll be  year cigarette free tomorrow Also about  months vape free as I quit that too in the summer.\n\nThat's after  years of smoking an being on  a day at the end.\n\nII hadn't thought about it in quite a while but it's so nice to be free of the slavery and drudgery of cigarettes and the ecigs really did help and take the edge of it.\n\nMarvellous.", "No, not a shill, but the iStick Pico is satisfying and very inexpensive. I paid  for mine. The Pico works well, but the tank is too small. Be prepared to fill it constantly.\n\nThe best advice I can give to a quitting smoker is to just skip all the things that look like a cigarette, especially Blu and the like, but also all the tube shaped vapes, and just go right to a box mod. Like the iStick Pico, or the Kangertech Subox Mini I started with. There are many options, all good, and the key for you will likely be price. I wasted money on Blu, wasted money on vapes that were cylindrical, and wasn't satisfied until I just got a real vape.\n\nI will not pretend that these are somehow better for you, though I think you'll be happier. It's just that they are so new, and I won't pretend there is science saying vapes are healthier. As of now, there isn't. In my opinion as a former cigarette smoker though, they are. At least a little bit.\n\nBUT\n\nThe immediate benefit you will get is that the vape solves nearly every problem nonsmokers had with a cigarette. You will not leave butts behind. Your house will not stink, even if you vape like mad all day. You will not make the clothes of others stink. In fact the most common comment I get from nonsmokers is something like, what is that wonderful smell I once stayed in a hotel that did not allow smoking in rooms, but was okay with the vape, even though we asked them twice to be sure. Oh, no matter how you fall asleep with your vape, you will not and cannot burn down the house. \n\nI very much suggest you treat the vape as though it were a cigarette. I vape outside, do not vape into other's faces, and etc. If I can smoke here, I can vape here. If I could not smoke here, I do not vape. If you maintain normal smoker's etiquette with the vape, you will have no problems. Abuse of that etiquette by douchenozzles in flame shirts is how this lovely advancement got a bad rap. \n\nThis is the one thing I, a middle aged man, am angry at millennials about. Why could you, of all people, not be cool. Why. And stop making Youtube videos about it. Only the dorkiest of Cigar Aficionados made a hobby about tobacco. That was one of the things that made it cool. Nobody actually nerded out about it. You just smoked, all casual. It looked poetic between a lady's fingers, and was associated with suffrage. Edward Munch made a point to paint himself holding oneURL.\n\nDrawbacks. The vape is not cool. It just isn't. It doesn't LOOK cool. I once had somebody laugh at me for sucking on the robot dick. Ain't nothing free. The main benefit of the cigarette is its slender profile, its poetry, it's association with fire. One can talk about breathing the air of hell. \n\nBut. Smoking is not cool. The kids don't smoke, these days. It's passe. Pretty girls and lovely boys didn't smoke much before, and now they really, really don't. The vape will not make your kiss taste like an ashtray. So even though the vape is a bit lame, well, smoking is even more lame. Those who are inclined to live and let live about vaping, despite its weird rep, will have real and understandable reasons to despise you if you continue to smoke. As I say, keep your smokers etiquette intact, and nonvapers will only comment on how lovely you make their world smell.\n\nIf not for some aholes trying really hard to be fedora cunts and spoil it, the vape conjures the dream of smoking, rooms full of artful fog, but when the nonsmoker walks into this fog, it smells like cherries, or butterscotch, not grimy tobacco. Frankly, you will not enjoy the flavors as much as they will, as scents. \n\nI cannot recommend the practice enough. Vape. Vape while you still can. \n\nAh. One last drawback. As a smoker, you were used to a cigarette being a cigarette forever, with few changes. But the vape is an electronic device made mostly in China. If somebody could recommend an American manufactured vape, please do, for some will care a lot about that. Like all electronics, vapes are constantly updated. New models and designs are forever being pushed out. The best of the designs stick around for a while, but you will be annoyed by your need to update. However, buy a popular model, and you will be satisfied for quite some time.\n\nAs per DONG_MAGNUM ffs Reddit posted, your days are sort of numbered here. They will soon regulate vapes into submission, and in a year, I don't know if my advice will be worthwhile. But for now, today, January 1st, there has never been a better time to buy a vape and ditch the smokes. I still fire up a cigarette here and there. I am never happy with it. You too can own this look of satisfaction.\n\nI cannot recommend vaping enough.

Compounding that, other methods can have pretty bad side effects. I was a BIG fucking tobacco user. I regularly used pipes, cigars, RYO, unfiltered, dip, chew, spliffs, dokha, hookah, snus, pouches. I was a tobacco enthusiast.  packs a day. Lots of money. Lots of tar. I've been vaping since before it became a thing. When vapes actually got good and I actually for real stopped using tobacco it was life changing. Sometimes I miss a real cigarette but man if I smoke one now its usually pretty fucking gross. Nothing really beats a dip either when you are working in the shop or on the lawn. I don't even dare try to roll one of my fine fine RYO cigs, rizla papers, amsterdam shag, swan filters. But ecig is pretty god damn good and I've got a gallon of liquid that cost me almost nothing and my gums arent fucked up, I don't smell like shit, I can breathe, I can smell, I can ascend stairs, I don't have the threat of heart and lung disease looming all over me, my clothes don't smell like shit, my car doesn't smell like shit, no ashes, no butts, no rolling down the window in the car even, no going outside in the cold, no yellow walls in my apartment, no burns on my couch, no hole in my wallet. \n\nMy biggest advice is get a good liquid and a good vape from the start. I started out when vapes and liquids were both pretty shitty and then in the middle years when shit could get expensive and frustrating I vaped and smoked or dipped. Thats my second biggest advice, get your good vape AND DO NOT SMOKE. I have one friend that vaped and quit and two friends that do both. I seriously can't even stand a cigarette now especially when I got some big hit of chocolately yummy cool vapor right in my pocket. \n\nAs far as cessation I've only ever seen two people quit that I personally know. My dad did every fucking method inhalers, gum for YEARS, patches, welbutrin, pouches for years all have side effects worse than vaping AFAIK. After like  fucking years supposedly he quit. The other person I know got a shitty ecig and weened himself down by milligram and quit easy. Literally of all the people I personally know thats it. But then theres me, I love nicotine, I love the oral fixation, I love it with a beer, I love it in the car, and I got three batteries and a big fuckin dripper ready to bang bang. \n\nI started with those weird old clear things marketed on the internet that vaped who knows what. It faded out because it sucked then Blu came out. Tried that bullshit it was okay, or so I thought, kept smoking. Vaped on and off for a few years, mostly with a pen style and an old school  dripper. Then slightly more quality mods and more powerful tanks started coming out but they were still kinda frustrating and shitty and expensive. When affordable mods and subohm tanks hit the market I entered the golden age. My first decent ecig when I finally quit was an internal battery 35w mod with a 1ohm coil in a tank. Cost me about , and it was kind of a piece of shit. Over the years 32mg, to 24mg, to 18mg, usually  a bottle. I currently vape a   battery mod that holds up to all kinds of abuse and pumps  fuckin watts and I got big fat nichrome juggernaut dual coils totalling .2ohms in a Doge and I'm assblastin VG 3mg clouds that cost me THIRTY FIVE CENTS a bottle. \n\nIf you wanna quit go get a decent  mod, sub ohm tank, and play around in the 8mg14mg range until you don't crave. Wheen yourself off down to 0mg and work on getting rid of the fixation. Keep a bottle of 2mg around for emergencies. If you're like me, just start out with a nice  mod  a nice tank  and a nice dripper  fuck the drama  play around in the 4mh8mg range until you can get down to 3mg, and puff the fuck away. Either way your smell will improve, your breath will improve, if you smoke weed your ass gonna be coughin and takin huge hits and gettin hella high and the weed gonna taste hecka good, you gonna be goin up stairs like a motherfucker. \n\nP.S.

Let's get this on /r/all for the 3rd time! Quitting smoking for your New Years resolution? We can help! Pop over to /r/electronic_cigarette and see how vaping has helped us!|*|["19 year smoker; vaping for 17 months now. Tried the disposables, worked for a couple of weeks, went back to the fags. Bought a crappy setup from the equivalent of a mall kiosk, it broke after a week. Back to the fags. Daughter was born. HAVE to quit smoking. Came to /r/ecr, listened in on /u/chris2vaped doing a QnA where people were asking the questions that I wanted to ask. Invested $60 in a decent setup and here I am now. I relapsed once - on day 11 I had to have a cigarette. 2 puffs later it tasted so vile I tossed it and haven't had any since. Vaping isn't a magic bullet, you do still need a little willpower for the first couple of weeks - your body's addicted to all the other crap that's in cigarettes beside the nicotine and it takes a little while for that to fade out - but since then it's been plain sailing. Dropped the nicotine level from 18mg to 1mg, and hopefully I'll quit vaping soon too. \n\nDon't be afraid to ask anyone here questions. There's no such thing as a silly one. If you think you do have a silly one and you don't want to put it in a thread, PM myself or /u/twin_sis or /u/hometownzero or anybody really. I have a 19 month old. I have to ask silly questions every day. Why is your teddy bear in the shower? Why is the dog covered in stickers? And you'll get a straighter answer from /r/electronic_cigarette than I ever get.", 'Your teddy bear is in the shower because he needs to follow simple rules of hygene and the dog is covered by stickers to help people see how great they are.', "Can you pm me the set up you used? My husband wants to start but we're lost when it comes to deciding to what to buy to start. ", "I just wanted to say I think it's super sweet you quit for you daughter! \n\nI'm 20 now and have never smoked a cigarette in my life but my mom, aunt and grandma have all smoked 20+ years (my gramma smoking on and off for ~40 years) and I really hated it as a kid. I actually developed asthma from being around cigarette smoke so much growing up.\n\nAnyways, I decided for my 18th instead of asking for any presents or anything I would ask my family to stop smoking. I started crying and told them I just really wanted them to be in my life for a long time and smoking wasn't helping. It seemed to kick their butts into gear and they haven't smoked for 2 years! They instead picked up vaping and the 3 of them are all really into it :) It helped them a lot and I'm really happy they quit and are healthier! ", "Congrats!  You are right there is no dumb question and thanks for including me.  I'm happy to help!", "Here from r/all and know basically nothing about vaping. Since you are open for questions: what set up did you invest in? Do different set ups have different pros and cons? For example, I have tried a few of those cheap gas station ecigs and my main problems were 1) I hated not being able to FEEL the hit in my throat. I don't know, I guess I've just grown accustomed to that feeling and it helps satisfy my urge. And 2) I had no idea when to stop smoking. With a normal cigarette I just go out, light up and then put it out when it's finished. I feel like with the ecigs I tried I just wanted to puff and puff and puff, there was no clear end. Sorry for the ramble. Any help is greatly appreciated.", "I'll help wherever I can! Mahalo for the mention, very kind of you. \n\nNow let us get some ex-smokers on a new path. \n\n\nAloha\n\n", "I'm from South-Africa - I have a vape store - even in this dark and weird corner of the world vaping is gaining ground. So if you feel that in our strange corner, vaping might be too new, or too 'out there', PM me, I promise I will help - not just with my vape store, but with the vast amount of suppliers in SA. All of them out there to help you get that monkey off your back :)", "I started vaping yesterday.  I really want to quit cigarettes completely.  Only problem I'm having really is the scratchiness on my throat after doing it and coughing a bit. It won't affect my singing voice?", "Just hours away from 1 year smoke free!\n\nThis community is awesome. Thanks peeps!\n\nEdit: T-minus one hour &amp; counting. \n\n100% sure I'll never turn back. The only thing challenging that assumption?\n\nRepressive, Big Tobacco, that won't accept that the consumer is fed up with their control &amp; disease. \n\nEdit Edit: It's New Year's morning & 1 year smoke free! Yeah! Used to be I'd wake up with a disgusting mix of smoke & alcohol flavored gunk in my mouth on a morning like this. The alcohol is still there but it's a big difference. ", "Congrats! It's insane how this post has skyrocketed with upvotes in only four hours.. Impressive", 'Happy 1 year man!', "Even big tobacco can't stop us. We can still order devices from China and make our own juices. The cat is out of the bag and they won't be able to stuff it back in. ", "I smoked for 28 years, a little over a pack per day.  At 43, I found vaping and, in the last 16 months, I've had 1 cig.  Vaping is for ANYONE who wants to quit smoking.", 'Old guy here.  35 years i smoked a pack a day. 2 1/2 years off of the fuckers thanks to vaping.', 'Switched from smoking to vaping 4 years ago! My lungs seem happy about it :) \n\nI remember back in the day when e-Go came out and it was a game changer! Also when people figured out how to make carto-tanks by drilling tiny holes in their cartomizers... How times change! Now you can get a sick vape quicker than you can run down to the corner store and buying a pack of ciggys. Vaping really seems in its prime now and I love it!', "26 here, only smoked for 9 years (15-24) but was on 20 a day easily.\n\nSwitched to vaping, had 2 cigs in the last 2 years since I started (out on nights when battery died), and whilst I still enjoyed the cigs enough still, I much prefer vaping and would much rather not have another cig.\n\nI don't stink of stale smoke anymore, my mouth doesn't feel like ass half the day, I'm fitter and healthier than I've been in years, and whilst I know Vaping isn't GOOD for me, it's so so much better than smoking.  I've picked up running, going to the gym and everything again.", "I have been smoke free for 28 years. It's worth it.", 'Just turned 40, smoked for 20 years. It\'s been two years since I\'ve had a cigarette, all thanks to vaping. I don\'t go to vape shops and I don\'t preach about it, but I will say that it works. First couple weeks are pretty tough, and I still think about smoking from time to time, but if you do anything for that long, it\'s going to be a part of you for a very long time. \n\nQuitting smoking has never been easier. If you have a desire to quit, you CAN do it. This tastes better, smells better, and you will start to feel results QUICKLY. Those results will encourage you to keep going, and before you know it, you\'ve gone weeks without a cigarette. \n\nThere\'s a lot of quit smoking apps out there that can help you count the days, and counting days can be important when you\'re quitting. I didn\'t stop counting days until it had been well over a year. I opened that app several times a day for weeks. I checked how much money I hadn\'t spent on cigarettes, how many cigarettes I hadn\'t smoked, what health benefits I should expect, etc. I was still thinking about cigarettes, just as I had for the previous 20 years... i just wasn\'t smoking them. \n\nSome people say to throw out your pack of cigarettes when you have a set up for vaping. Personally, I did not. I kept my pack of cigarettes, because i knew the kind of anxiety that not having access to cigarettes caused me. I kept my last pack, and it was in plain sight in my bedroom. It was there if I absolutely needed it. Knowing that I could have a cigarette whenever I wanted actually helped me. When that craving hit me, I huffed on that goddamn vape like a fiend. But that craving would subside after 10 minutes of vaping hard, and I would completely forget about the cigarette. I tried one cigarette after a month of not having any - my cravings for them had subsided, I just wanted to see what I would think of them at that point. It was terrible, and I didn\'t finish it. I took a couple drags and put it out. It tasted bad, felt bad, and smelled bad. At that point, I knew I had won.\n\nWhen you first start, you might not know how long to vape in one go because it doesn\'t have the predestined time that a lit cigarette does. Don\'t be worried that you don\'t know when to stop. Just keep going until you feel like you\'ve had enough. Vape for an hour straight if you are having cravings. Just keep going until you\'ve had enough. You\'ll figure it out. \n\nSo I recommend finding a vaping solution that works for YOU... and at this point, it\'s not hard to find one! Don\'t worry about the people who say it looks stupid, say it\'s for douche bags, or whatever stigmas are attached at this point. You\'re doing something for your health, and you don\'t have to participate in any "vape culture".\n\nYou can quit, and it\'s never been easier than it is right now.', "Here's the bottom line for me.\n\nThree of my grandparents died of lung cancer.

They sell decent juice at really good prices. Before I started making my own this was the place I would go to buy the bulk of my juice. (I would recommend circus bear) As an added bonus they almost always throw in a free bottle or two, just because they are cool like that. 😎\n\n[Mt Baker Vapor](https://www.mtbakervapor.com/) \n\nThese guys sell fantastic juice at fantastic prices. They also sell flavorings which are very easy use if you are just staring DIY. I would personally recomend Moo Juice, its a very nice strawberry milk flavor.\n\n**To buy hardware:**\n\nIf you are juuuust starting out I would highly recommend an ego pen. They are what I started on and they both work and are extremely affordable. Right now [Vapes.com](https://www.vapes.com/shop/ego-ce4-vape-starter-kit-limited-time-offer/) is having a sale on a starter kit for $6. (Most places charge $20 or more for a pen, just to prey on the newcomers) \n\nFor a good starting device a step or two up from a pen I would recommend an [iStick 30w](https://www.misthub.com/product/eleaf-istick-30w-box-mod/). They currently are going for $26, but if you want to be able to use it you will need an atomizer. A good atomizer to start with is the [Aspire Atlantis 2](https://buyvaporizerpen.com/accessories/aspire-atlantis-2-sub-ohm?gclid=CjwKEAiAwZO0BRDvxs_1w-qFnhkSJABo10gge-z0mTnQAJkGTpWq6EaovqP5fRMtAp5GTEHC5nOvOxoCevHw_wcB). These are going for about 30 and are an extremely reliable, easy to use tank that holds around 3ml of juice. \n\nAnother fantastic starting device is the [Innokin Endura](http://www.myvaporstore.com/Innokin-Endura-T18-Starter-Kit-p/ink-end10.htm). This is a sleeker device that will only run you 30$ without having to buy a seperate atomizer. It features a 3ml tank and a 1000 mAh battery, which should last you a decent amount of time.\n\n**Choosing a nicotine strength:**\n\nMake sure to understand nicotine strength when ordering juice. (Keep in mind that in higher nicotine contents flavor will be harder to taste just due to the throat hit)\n\n0mg: No nicotine at all\n\n3mg: extremely light and almost unnoticeable in a pen, this works best with dripping atomizers or powerful tank setups.\n\n6mg: Pretty much the standard strength. Extremely light in a pen but not to strong in a dripper.\n\n12mg: Intermediate strength. Works decent in a pen and is bitey in dripper or tank. If you are quitting smoking I would recommend this if you are getting the iStick/atlantis setup I recommended earlier or something similar.\n\n18mg: Strong. Very bitey in a tank but can still be a decent choice depending on how long you have been smoking. This is pretty much the perfect strength in a pen.\n\n22+mg: Extremely strong. This is so strong to the point where it will mute the flavor of the juice due to its intense throat hit. Don't even bother running this in a tank or dripper unless you only plan on puffing. Mimics smoking really well in a pen though.\n\n30+mg: Anything this strong is either in a crappy gas station eCig or is nicotine base used in DIY eLiquid. Don't buy anything this strong unless you know what you are doing.\n\n**Understanding Vg/Pg ratios**\n\nMost juice is made with a vg/pg base.\n\nVg, or vegetable glycerin,  is a very viscous liquid that is metabolized into sugar. Due to its dense and viscous nature it creates a lot more vapor than pg. Pg, or propylene glycol, is a very runny substance that is found in many foods to preserve them and in asthma inhalers. It creates for more of a throat hit and carries flavor better. If you are running a pen I would recommend getting juice with a higher pg content than vg to taste the flavor a bit better, and if you are running a bigger device it would be better to get a higher vg content juice for less of a throat hit and more vapor production. \n\nIf these numbers are a bit confusing to you don't worry, most juice vendors have a way for you to select your nicotine strength and vg/pg ratio.\n\nTo recap, here is a helpful [infographic](http://imgur.com/a/THpUQ) that explains the parts of an e-cig and the ingredients to e-juice.\n\nWith all that being said I hope you have a wonderful mew year and vape on!\n", 'This is a good write up.\n\nHowever, I definitely think that the Atlantis is not that great of a starter tank by any means.  If you\'re a noobie, I would strongly, *strongly* recommend buying an [Innokin Endura](http://www.vapordna.com/Innokin-Endura-T18-Compact-Starter-Kit-p/endura.htm) as it has recently been released to rave reviews as the quintessential "made for smokers" starter kit.  \n\nIf you still want to go with the iStick 30w, I think that the [Nautilus Mini](http://www.vapordna.com/Aspire-Nautilus-Mini-Adjustable-Airflow-BVC-Tank-p/asb002.htm) is a great companion, however the tank alone is more expensive than the full Endura kit.\n\nIf anyone looking to quit smoking has any questions about gear or anything related, feel free to shoot me a PM.

I was looking for a way to cut back on my smoking.  It was in the back of my mind that I would ultimately quit, but I was mainly concerned with cutting back.  I picked up an Ego starter kit and some 12mg liquid... then had to go right back and but some 24mg liquid since 12 didn't quite do it.

Stereotypical right?  Well I had been combo smoking using a cig-a-like and smokes for a couple months.  Winter of 2013 did me in.  I got some kind of bronchial infection and I almost went to the emergency room a few times because I thought I was dying.  Waking up at 4am not being able to breathe, that fun stuff.  Back then I had a 3 year old and ultimately it came to a finality of “It’s selfish and I’m too young to feel like this”.  So I had already cut down drastically from a pack a day to maybe 3-4 but New Years Eve I decided no more.  \n\nIt’s not easy by any means and it’s not a direct replacement but it worked.  You gotta have some balls or drive to shrug them off for good but it’s possible and vaping definitely helped immensely where I failed many times before.  I’ve vaped for 2 ½ years or so now with 2 years steady after having smoked for 14 years.  I enjoy it.  It’s a hobby, it’s stress relief, it’s relaxation, it’s community.  Find what you like and want and go after it.  There are tons of devices to try, different ways to vape, different flavors, and vendors.  Find it and latch on and don’t go back.  It may seem like a lateral step and you’re making no progress (btw fuck people who tell you so) but trust me you are and your health in a few months will be eye opening.  The way I vape now is entirely different from my first 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year.  I like different flavors, use different devices, have different favorites.  It will change with you and there is no wrong way to do it.  Just don’t go back to smoking.  Ignore the vapeholes, the stigma, all that nonsense.  Do it for you and how you want to finally stop smoking.\n", "I tried patches, gum, welbutrin, electro-shock therapy, sacrificing goats, cold turkey, warm turkey, leftover turkey.  Nothing worked.

It was there if I absolutely needed it. Knowing that I could have a cigarette whenever I wanted actually helped me. When that craving hit me, I huffed on that goddamn vape like a fiend.

P ", "To all newcomers Welcome\n\nBefore you start there are a few places and things you should know about.\n\nTo buy juice\n\nVapewildURL\n\nIf you are a beginner this is an excellent place to start They sell decent juice at really good prices. Before I started making my own this was the place I would go to buy the bulk of my juice. I would recommend circus bear As an added bonus they almost always throw in a free bottle or two, just because they are cool like that. \n\nMt Baker VaporURL \n\nThese guys sell fantastic juice at fantastic prices. They also sell flavorings which are very easy use if you are just staring DIY. I would personally recomend Moo Juice, its a very nice strawberry milk flavor.\n\nTo buy hardware\n\nIf you are juuuust starting out I would highly recommend an ego pen. They are what I started on and they both work and are extremely affordable. Right now Vapes.comURL is having a sale on a starter kit for . Most places charge  or more for a pen, just to prey on the newcomers \n\nFor a good starting device a step or two up from a pen I would recommend an iStick 30wURL. They currently are going for , but if you want to be able to use it you will need an atomizer. A good atomizer to start with is the Aspire Atlantis URL. These are going for about  and are an extremely reliable, easy to use tank that holds around 3ml of juice. \n\nAnother fantastic starting device is the Innokin EnduraURL. This is a sleeker device that will only run you  without having to buy a seperate atomizer. It features a 3ml tank and a  mAh battery, which should last you a decent amount of time.\n\nChoosing a nicotine strength\n\nMake sure to understand nicotine strength when ordering juice. Keep in mind that in higher nicotine contents flavor will be harder to taste just due to the throat hit\n\n0mg No nicotine at all\n\n3mg extremely light and almost unnoticeable in a pen, this works best with dripping atomizers or powerful tank setups.\n\n6mg Pretty much the standard strength. Extremely light in a pen but not to strong in a dripper.\n\n12mg Intermediate strength. Works decent in a pen and is bitey in dripper or tank. If you are quitting smoking I would recommend this if you are getting the iStickatlantis setup I recommended earlier or something similar.\n\n18mg Strong. Very bitey in a tank but can still be a decent choice depending on how long you have been smoking. This is pretty much the perfect strength in a pen.\n\nmg Extremely strong. This is so strong to the point where it will mute the flavor of the juice due to its intense throat hit. Don't even bother running this in a tank or dripper unless you only plan on puffing. Mimics smoking really well in a pen though.\n\nmg Anything this strong is either in a crappy gas station eCig or is nicotine base used in DIY eLiquid. Don't buy anything this strong unless you know what you are doing.\n\nUnderstanding VgPg ratios\n\nMost juice is made with a vgpg base.\n\nVg, or vegetable glycerin,  is a very viscous liquid that is metabolized into sugar. Due to its dense and viscous nature it creates a lot more vapor than pg. Pg, or propylene glycol, is a very runny substance that is found in many foods to preserve them and in asthma inhalers. It creates for more of a throat hit and carries flavor better. If you are running a pen I would recommend getting juice with a higher pg content than vg to taste the flavor a bit better, and if you are running a bigger device it would be better to get a higher vg content juice for less of a throat hit and more vapor production. \n\nIf these numbers are a bit confusing to you don't worry, most juice vendors have a way for you to select your nicotine strength and vgpg ratio.\n\nTo recap, here is a helpful infographicURL that explains the parts of an ecig and the ingredients to ejuice.\n\nWith all that being said I hope you have a wonderful mew year and vape on\n", "This is a good write up.\n\nHowever, I definitely think that the Atlantis is not that great of a starter tank by any means.

We were complete newbies, the local vape shop walked us through everything, had samples for her to try of different flavors and was able to add the appropriate nicotine level for her.\n\nShe was a die-hard smoker before. Pleas to quit fell on deaf ears. She was steadfast.\n\nOnce she tried e-cigs and finished the pack of tobacco she had open, she never had another one. She even tried to return the rest of her tobacco carton to the local gas station for a refund (not sure if that worked or not, she said she was a "good customer" so probably so). She had insisted on a menthol flavor juice and plenty of nicotine, within days she was eager to explore more options and ended up with a Tutti Fruitti-type flavor, when initially she said she didn\'t want "weird" flavors.\n\nShe was a hardcore smoker for 40+ years. She quit that basically cold turkey, saves a tons of money, sleeps better at night and has more energy during the day. I hate that shadow organizations advance a negative agenda on e-cigs.

Congrats!", "I am a chronic pain patient and smoked 3+ packs of home rolled cigarettes a day for 29 years. That is very important to note because I didn't just smoke for nicotine. I NEEDED cigarettes because they helped to control my pain. Even still I accidentally quit smoking in June 2014 and the results have been so dramatic it is amazing. I never thought I could quit. EVER! I never even tried. I fiddled with e-cigs from the very first Chinese ciga-likes cicra 2007 on out until one day on a whim I went to a local shop and bought a decent midrange starter setup (think ego and aspire not evod) and within a month I was no longer a dual user. I was a vaper and an ex-smoker. I feel better but do have more pain but that was coming anyhow. You don't recover from Degenerative Disc Disease and that is just one tiny problem in the grocery list of things that cause me debilitating pain.\n\nMy Doctors are so on board with this switch they do not think I ever need to even lower my nicotine level.  All signs of my having ever smoked are disappearing and fast. My lungs were always clear and good with no shadowing but there is some visible healing showing on my latest chest x-rays. So I guess I did have some physical changes in my lungs after all. I have lowered my nicotine though. I went from 36MG in May to 18MG around October and my next round of huge purchasing will be in a few months I might drop down to 12MG at that point. \n\nI am extremely overweight due to Celiac, Allergies, Insane amounts of Steroids, Lyrica, bad genetics and emotional eating to dull the pain but I didn't gain any weight when I quit smoking. I actually lost weight because these amazing flavors help keep the part of my weight problem I can control in check. I no longer reach for things I am allergic too because I have such amazing flavors to vape like a Blueberry Custard with an awesome name like Jizmogoblin from Mt. Baker Vapor.\n \nThat is also important to note. Flavors keep me from overeating. I didn't get that metabolic slow down many people experience when they quit smoking. It was actually the reverse. So amazing.\n\nMy Blood Pressure was never bad enough for medication but would spike with severe pain. The last time someone smashed me in my car my BP was 180 in the ER. They were worried I was going to have a heart attack because they couldn't control my pain. I have since then been in comparable pain and my Blood Pressure never even topped out at 140. This might not be a huge change but my resting pulse dropped from 86 to 70 which is pretty amazing for a sedentary severely overweight person who can barely walk. I did nothing but switch to vaping. \n\nMy hair and nails started to grow like crazy when I quit smoking too. This is also amazing because I suffer from eczema over 80% of my body including my scalp. I was losing my hair last year and now it's growing despite that fact I bleach it to death every month to control the rash. My nails were so brittle from the lack of nutrients I absorb but do grow now that I quit smoking.\n\nOne final note is that I need surgery. My spine in my neck is beyond recovery. My cervical spine has straightened and is now bowing in the wrong direction. One disc has tri-compartmental stenosis which means the nerves are being compressed in 3 directions. I am the type of case that you hear about when someone just wakes up paralyzed. That risk is real for me. I need surgery. No doctor would touch me before because I smoked. The best case scenario is 20% fusion healing with a smoker. It goes up to almost 50% now that I quit. I need a tri-level fusion and that is a hugely complicated surgery with an obviously high failure rate. I do not have the Science to prove this only the various Surgeons who fired me because I smoked. They refused to do the surgery even though they told me I have no choice but to have it. I even had a Healer/Physical Therapist/Chiropractor refuse to take my case because he said he didn't think he should try to help me heal when I am undoing all of it by smoking. This man said this to me five years ago. It didn't even phase me other then crying my eyes out from the pain. I just kept on smoking. I was in real danger of death or a horrific quality of life but didn't even try to quit. Vaping has saved my life, very literally saved my life.\n\nIf anyone needs someone to talk to or recommendations on setups or even a freebie pack of juice, shoot me a PM. I have some flavors from Mt. Baker Vapor I'd be willing to ship for free to you if you need some help with juice and are over 18 in the USA. I do not know how many people I can help as I am on a very limited income being on SSDI but I will try. \n\nIf you take anything away from this long post take this:\n\nYou can quit smoking. You really can quit smoking and vaping can help you do it.\n\nHere's to a SMOKELESS 2015!!!!\n\nMuch Love and Healing to All,\n\nAnna\n", "Have you ever heard about kratom? It's a leaf from a tree that grows in Southeast Asia. Surprisingly this treatment evolved in such a way that it contains chemicals in it that act like opiods found in poppy plants but work completely differently.

A ziplining contraption I created with 1000+ command blocks|*|['The amount of detail you put into this is astounding, well done man', 'Granted, the hoard of zombies I was running from ate me 20 minutes ago, but still very cool.', 'Not gonna lie, at first I didn’t actually think this was in game just because of how smooth it looks lol', 'Hypixel wants to know your location', 'Especially the sound, that will surely distract me from the fact that my 5+ year old Ipad would probably explode if I ever tried it.', 'That looks like a LOT of falling sand entities', "How in the heck, those are the best animations in game I've ever seen, didn't know you could do that type of stuff with command blocks that's insane. Well done!!!", 'With armor stands, you can do anything. They truly are one of the most underrated block in the game.', "I guess this is a better comment if any to generally cover how it was done. Generally is a bit vague in this case.\n\nBasically, virtually everything that composes of the cannon and the chair is an entity of some sort, each with different sizes for different needs. They are either a falling block riding an armor stand, a block in the head slot of an armor stand, a block in a minecart (with the display offset increased to hide the minecart from view), or an item in the hand slot of an armor stand.\n\nFalling blocks share the same size as regular blocks. It is necessary that it is riding on the armor stand, as teleporting a falling block is not always smooth. Blocks on armor stand heads and in their hands also work well, but their sizes are a bit of hindrance, and they are difficult to position and orient due to the nature of modifying the direction of each armor stand part. Blocks in minecarts are larger and can be rotated in unique directions, but they are slightly less responsive compared to armor stands, have collision boxes which can cause them to bump into other minecarts and cannot be rotated or teleported without their rotation resetting.\n\nTo make the entities move, you basically just use an /execute command to target the specific entity to teleport at specific timings. How Minecraft works with teleporting entities is that they do not just immediately appear in the desired destination; they quickly jump/glide there instead, giving a sense of smooth movement. To make parts rotate, you can use /data to modify the data of the entity to edit their Rotation NBT tag.\n\nFor the more 'mechanical' parts, I have the command blocks following the main teleporting command blocks to teleport it back a portion of the difference it moved (i.e. -0.1 blocks from 1 block), and then teleporting it, in the command blocks following those, forward the same distance. This gives the allusion of each component having some mass.\n\nTo sit on the chair itself, there is an invisible llama. My first choice was saddled pigs, as they were small as easy to work with. However, saddles do not turn invisible along with the mob, so other options such as striders were not possible. Minecarts, boats also proved a challenge due to their small detection boxes. Horses were too big and trying to ride one violently propelled me in a random direction due to the collision boxes of all the entities surrounding it.", 'Probably just setting the velocity of the entities at various timings but yeah it’s amazing', 'I kind of wish you could do that type of stuff in real life.', 'Wait, command blocks meaning this was done in vanilla?', 'The blocks tilting in an unnatural way, are thanks to armor stands', 'Yes.', "Fucking hell.

Well done", 'With armor stands, you can do anything. They truly are one of the most underrated block in the game.', "I guess this is a better comment if any to generally cover how it was done. Generally is a bit vague in this case.\n\nBasically, virtually everything that composes of the cannon and the chair is an entity of some sort, each with different sizes for different needs. They are either a falling block riding an armor stand, a block in the head slot of an armor stand, a block in a minecart with the display offset increased to hide the minecart from view, or an item in the hand slot of an armor stand.\n\nFalling blocks share the same size as regular blocks. It is necessary that it is riding on the armor stand, as teleporting a falling block is not always smooth. Blocks on armor stand heads and in their hands also work well, but their sizes are a bit of hindrance, and they are difficult to position and orient due to the nature of modifying the direction of each armor stand part. Blocks in minecarts are larger and can be rotated in unique directions, but they are slightly less responsive compared to armor stands, have collision boxes which can cause them to bump into other minecarts and cannot be rotated or teleported without their rotation resetting.\n\nTo make the entities move, you basically just use an execute command to target the specific entity to teleport at specific timings. How Minecraft works with teleporting entities is that they do not just immediately appear in the desired destination they quickly jumpglide there instead, giving a sense of smooth movement. To make parts rotate, you can use data to modify the data of the entity to edit their Rotation NBT tag.\n\nFor the more 'mechanical' parts, I have the command blocks following the main teleporting command blocks to teleport it back a portion of the difference it moved i.e. . blocks from  block, and then teleporting it, in the command blocks following those, forward the same distance. This gives the allusion of each component having some mass.\n\nTo sit on the chair itself, there is an invisible llama. My first choice was saddled pigs, as they were small as easy to work with. However, saddles do not turn invisible along with the mob, so other options such as striders were not possible. Minecarts, boats also proved a challenge due to their small detection boxes. Horses were too big and trying to ride one violently propelled me in a random direction due to the collision boxes of all the entities surrounding it.", 'Probably just setting the velocity of the entities at various timings but yeah its amazing', 'I kind of wish you could do that type of stuff in real life.', 'Wait, command blocks meaning this was done in vanilla', 'The blocks tilting in an unnatural way, are thanks to armor stands', 'Yes.', "Fucking hell.

The steepest walkable staircase possible in 1.16|*|["This is really slick! I'd be curious to know how sprinting affects it though.

I did this by placing a closed fence gate on the right side of the stairs (in front of the slab).\n\nEdit: using a string, observer, and a piston (pressure plate will open the fence gate), I was able to make it practically “walk-on”.
